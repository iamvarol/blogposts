CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath, cough, and fever._x000D_
_x000D_
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 67 -year-old_x000D_
Russian speaking female with a past medical history_x000D_
significant for diabetes type II, congestive heart failure of_x000D_
unknown etiology, and hypertension.  The patient presents_x000D_
with a three day history of progressively worsening shortness_x000D_
of breath and dyspnea on exertion, wheezing, nonproductive_x000D_
cough, and fever to 102 F on the day prior to admission.  Per_x000D_
patient's husband, she denies any nausea or vomiting, chills_x000D_
at night, night sweats, or chest pain.  She denies diarrhea._x000D_
She has been constipated.  The patient does have paroxysmal_x000D_
nocturnal dyspnea and two pillow orthopnea.  The patient_x000D_
denies dysuria.  Fingersticks at home have been running_x000D_
approximately 200 to 270's.  The patient denies any sick_x000D_
contacts._x000D_
_x000D_
On the morning of presentation, the patient was noted to be_x000D_
more lethargic by her husband.  [**Name (NI) **] report, her oxygen_x000D_
saturation upon arrival of the EMS, was in the 80's.  The_x000D_
patient was placed on 100% nonrebreather and arrived at [**Hospital3 **] - [**Hospital **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] where she was noted to be_x000D_
wheezing on examination.  She was given Albuterol and_x000D_
Atrovent nebulizers with improvement of her oxygen saturation_x000D_
from 90% to 94%, also on 100% nonrebreather.  She was also_x000D_
administered 40 mg of IV Lasix times two with diuresis of_x000D_
approximately one liter.  The patient denied any chest pain_x000D_
throughout her entire presentation._x000D_

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature on presentation was 99.1_x000D_
F, pulse is 84, blood pressure was 116/50, breathing at a_x000D_
rate of 19, 96% on 100% nonrebreather.  Weight was_x000D_
approximately 286 pounds.  In general, the patient was alert_x000D_
and oriented times three, on 100% nonrebreather, in moderate_x000D_
respiratory distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat:_x000D_
pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and_x000D_
accommodation bilaterally, oropharynx is clear.  Neck is_x000D_
without lymphadenopathy, there is not any assessable jugular_x000D_

_x000D_
ADMISSION LABORATORY DATA:  Include a white blood cell count_x000D_
of 8.2, hematocrit of 39.6, platelets are 310,000._x000D_
Chemistries showed a sodium of 138, potassium of 5.0,_x000D_
chloride 96, bicarbonate is 34, BUN is 17, creatinine 0.6,_x000D_
serum glucose is 231.  Urinalysis was negative for blood,_x000D_
nitrates, with 30 protein, greater than 1,000 glucose,_x000D_
negative ketones, and no cells.  Troponin on admission was_x000D_
1.4, CK on admission was 176 with an MB fraction of 2.0._x000D_
Second CK was 153 with an MB fraction of 3.0.  Calcium was_x000D_
8.3, albumin 3.5, magnesium 4.9, phosphate 1.9._x000D_
_x000D_
Chest x-ray on admission showed florid congestive heart_x000D_
failure with no evidence of pleural effusion, but perihilar_x000D_
haziness and more confluent of opacification of the lung_x000D_
bases and retrocardiac region.  Electrocardiogram showed a_x000D_
left bundle branch block, stable from comparison_x000D_
electrocardiogram of [**2165-10-30**], with no acute ST-T wave_x000D_
changes indicative of ongoing ischemia._x000D_
_x000D_
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted and started on a_x000D_
regimen for treatment of acute pulmonary edema.  The patient_x000D_
was aggressively diuresed with 80 mg of IV Lasix [**Hospital1 **] and_x000D_
oxygenated with face mask O2 as needed to keep oxygen_x000D_
saturations greater than 92%.  Levaquin 500 mg po q day was_x000D_
also initiated for treatment of presumptive pneumonia.  The_x000D_
patient remained initially stable overnight; however, on_x000D_
hospital day two was noted to be increasingly somnolent._x000D_
_x000D_
An arterial blood gas was measured at this time which_x000D_
revealed a pH of 7.2, pO2 of 42, pCO2 of 104.  The patient_x000D_
was sent for a stat CT scan angiogram to rule out pulmonary_x000D_
embolism.  This study, although grossly limited, did not find_x000D_
any major perfusion deficits in the pulmonary vascular_x000D_
system.  The patient was continued to be aggressively_x000D_
diuresed.  She was also placed on BiPAP, however, the patient_x000D_
did not tolerate the BiPAP apparatus.  The patient was_x000D_
transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for closer_x000D_
monitoring and optimization of respiratory status in the_x000D_
setting of hypercarbic respiratory failure of unclear_x000D_
etiology with underlying congestive heart failure and_x000D_
pneumonia, both of which were being treated._x000D_
_x000D_
While in the Intensive Care Unit, the patient's oxygenation_x000D_
was maximized with CPAP at bed time at 20 cm of water which_x000D_
the patient intermittently tolerated and five liters of_x000D_
oxygen via nasal cannula during the day.  Repeat arterial_x000D_
blood gas prior to discharge from the Medical Intensive Care_x000D_
Unit, was pH of 7.36 with CO2 of 87 and a pO2 of 61.  The_x000D_
patient was transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] team after her Medical_x000D_
Intensive Care Unit course._x000D_
_x000D_
While on the floor, the patient continued to improve on CPAP_x000D_
of 5.0 cm to 10 cm of water at bedtime.  She was unable to_x000D_
tolerate any further increase beyond this point.  The_x000D_
patient's oxygenation remained stable on four to five liters_x000D_
of oxygen via nasal cannula during the day time.  The patient_x000D_
continued to be aggressively diuresed.  It was noted that_x000D_
intermittently throughout her hospital course, the patient_x000D_
was experiencing gross hematuria through her Foley catheter._x000D_
At the time her subcutaneous heparin was discontinued.  In_x000D_
addition, this was believed to be secondary to the fact that_x000D_
the patient was intermittently on heparin around the time of_x000D_
admission as empiric therapy for a possible pulmonary_x000D_
embolus._x000D_
_x000D_
Upon returning to the Medical Floor, the patient was noted_x000D_
also to have intermittent alarms on telemetry of paroxysmal_x000D_
multi-focal atrial tachycardia and frequent runs of_x000D_
supraventricular tachycardia.  The patient's Albuterol_x000D_
nebulizers were believed to be contributing to this and these_x000D_
were placed on a prn basis.  In addition, secondary to the_x000D_
patient's persistent wheezing, her beta blocker was stopped_x000D_
and she was switched to Diltiazem.  For further_x000D_
characterization of the patient's congestive heart failure, a_x000D_
transthoracic echocardiogram was obtained to assess the_x000D_
patient's systolic function for any further causes for_x000D_
possible diastolic dysfunction._x000D_
_x000D_
Echocardiogram windows were severely limited secondary to the_x000D_
patient's body habitus; however, preliminary [**Location (un) 1131**] was of a_x000D_
sustained systolic function.  Over the following day of her_x000D_
hospitalization, the patient was evaluated by Physical_x000D_
Therapy, was ambulating well, and was switched to po regimens_x000D_
for her diuretics.  Fingerstick blood sugars throughout the_x000D_
hospitalization remained well controlled and the patient was_x000D_
covered with insulin sliding scale._x000D_
_x000D_
DISPOSITION:  The patient was discharged to a rehabilitation_x000D_
facility in stable condition._x000D_
_x000D_
DISCHARGE STATUS:  Stable to rehabilitation._x000D_
_x000D_
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient is to follow up with_x000D_
Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) 19512**] in one to two weeks.  At this time she_x000D_
will also be scheduled for further outpatient pulmonary_x000D_
follow up for characterization of her restrictive lung_x000D_
disease and for further evaluation of possible obstructive_x000D_
lung disease._x000D_

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 68 year old_x000D_
female with a history of morbid obesity, history of sleep_x000D_
apnea, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, congestive heart_x000D_
failure with diastolic dysfunction, restrictive lung disease,_x000D_
the Emergency Department with a chief complaint of increasing_x000D_
shortness of breath for four to five days.  The patient had_x000D_
mild productive cough but no fevers or chills.  Prior to her_x000D_
admission on [**2167-11-27**], her O2 saturation dropped from the_x000D_
low-90s which is her baseline, down to 78 to 80% at home with_x000D_
a heart rate in the 130s to 140s._x000D_
_x000D_
of 99.8 F.; blood pressure 123/70; heart rate 130 to 140;_x000D_
respirations 30; 02 saturation 80% on room air, up to 95% on_x000D_
four to five liters.  She was found to be atrial fibrillation_x000D_
with rapid ventricular response to the 140s and started on_x000D_
heparin and Diltiazem for rate control._x000D_
_x000D_
After admission to the Medical Floor on [**2167-11-27**], she_x000D_
required more oxygen to the point of 100% face mask._x000D_
Arterial blood gas was initially 7.23, 98, 117, 100%_x000D_
non-rebreather mask; 7.25, 95, 58, on 5 liters nasal cannula,_x000D_
to 7.25, 99, 75, on Bi-PAP, then to 7.26, 96, 72, on C-PAP._x000D_
She was transferred to the Cardiac Care Unit on [**2167-11-28**],_x000D_
for cardiac and respiratory failure._x000D_
_x000D_
Her issues in the Cardiac Care Unit included:_x000D_
1.      Pulmonary:  Respiratory failure secondary to_x000D_
hypoventilation secondary to morbid obesity in the setting of_x000D_
restrictive lung disease and congestive heart failure.  The_x000D_
patient did not require intubation and continued on Bi-PAP_x000D_
and C-PAP.  She was started on potassium chloride and_x000D_
progesterone to increase her respiratory drive.  On_x000D_
[**2167-12-1**], the patient was started on nasal cannula O2_x000D_
during the day with continued Bi-PAP at night.  Her O2_x000D_
saturation on nasal cannula of four to five liters was as low_x000D_
as 90%._x000D_
2.      Cardiovascular:  Congestive heart failure; the_x000D_
patient was aggressively diuresed with intravenous Lasix, for_x000D_
a total of nine liters negative while in the Cardiac Care_x000D_
Unit.  Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation:  Started on_x000D_
anti-coagulation on Diltiazem and digoxin._x000D_
3.      Gastrointestinal:  Constipation; aggressive bowel_x000D_
regimen including Lactulose and GoLYTELY._x000D_
4.      Decreased mental status:  Believed to be secondary to_x000D_
hypoxia and hypercarbia, resolved with improved oxygenation._x000D_
_x000D_
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:_x000D_
1.  Restrictive lung disease with PFTs, FEV of 1.38, 77%, FVC_x000D_

HOSPITAL COURSE:_x000D_
1.      Pulmonary:  Hypercarbic respiratory failure secondary_x000D_
to morbid obesity/hypoventilatioin and CHF.  She was continued on_x000D_
nasal cannula during_x000D_
the day.  Her O2 saturations improved to 93 to 97% on 2_x000D_
liters via nasal cannula.  An attempt to continue Bi-PAP at_x000D_
night was tried, however, the patient's O2 saturations_x000D_
dropped to the high 80s on bi-PAP.  Instead, she was kept on_x000D_
her nasal cannula at night.  The patient was tried on CPAP but_x000D_
did not tolerate this either. 2. Cardiovascular:  Congestive_x000D_
heart failure; the_x000D_
patient continued to be diuresed with intravenous Lasix._x000D_
Total diuresis to date negative 12 to 15 liters._x000D_
_x000D_
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter:  Cardiology_x000D_
was consulted for a possible transesophageal echocardiogram_x000D_
and cardioversion.  They did not recommend cardioversion now as_x000D_
she cannot tolerate TEE due to need to lie flat.Plan to f/u with_x000D_
cardiology as outpatient after several weeks anticoagualtion and_x000D_
consider cardioversion at that time. The patient was_x000D_
continued on Diltiazem and digoxin.  Her rate was still_x000D_
poorly controlled.  A beta blocker was added.  There_x000D_
is a questionable history of beta blocker intolerance_x000D_
with wheezing reported on prior admit however pt's OMR med list_x000D_
indicates that she was on atenolol at the time of admisison. She_x000D_
had no wheezing while on beta blockers here ofr last 2 days of_x000D_
admit._x000D_
_x000D_
Coronary artery disease:  The patient has a history of_x000D_
positive stress tests with reversible defects.  Cardiology_x000D_
was consulted for possible cardiac catheterization.  The_x000D_
patient refused cardiac catheterization since she is unable_x000D_
to lie flat.  The patient was continued on Statin and_x000D_
aspirin.Repeat TTE was done that showed decraesd EF of 35-40%_x000D_
and multiple regional wall motion abnormalities. beta blocker_x000D_
and ACE-I have been added to help with CAD and CHF managament._x000D_
_x000D_
Aortic stenosis murmur on examination with mild AS confirmed on_x000D_

Brief Hospital Course:_x000D_
71 yo Russian speaking female with extensive PMH presents with_x000D_
weight gain and increased fatigue over the past 3-4 weeks._x000D_
1)Anemia: Pt was recently admitted in [**2170-5-31**] for anemia_x000D_
work-up and found to have a bleeding gastric ectasia on EGD_x000D_
which was removed.  Colonoscopy at that time revealed a benign_x000D_
polyp.  Pt was found to have Hct of 18 on this admission.  Pt_x000D_
was transferred to the CCU for monitoring and received 8 units_x000D_
of PRBC with appropriate increase from 18 to 33.  The anemia was_x000D_
thought to be subacute since she was never hemodynamically_x000D_
unstable. GI was consulted.  Coumadin was held for suspected GI_x000D_
bleed.  Colonoscopy was scheduled but held for persistent high_x000D_
INR which was reversed with vitamin K.  Pt was a difficult prep_x000D_
and required almost 4-5 days of prepping with Golytely and other_x000D_
laxative.  Pt finally underwent colonoscopy which revealed no_x000D_
source of bleed.  Since pt's Hct was stable 25 34-35, no further_x000D_
diagnostic procedure was done.  If pt were to develop another_x000D_
acute/subacute anemia, capsule study was recommended._x000D_
_x000D_
2) CHF: Pt has a long hx of CHF per old records. Last echo_x000D_
before admission was from [**2168**] which showed EF of 35-40%.  She_x000D_
got an echo on [**9-20**] which showed EF>55%.  Pt was initially_x000D_
started on niseritide and lasix for diuresis for suspected CHF_x000D_
exacerbation before her initial Hct of 18 came back.  Pt_x000D_
received lasix between transfusions.  Lisinopril was held for_x000D_
increased creatinine.  Pt's wt was stable and CHF status was_x000D_
stable initially.  However, after 5 days of prep for the_x000D_
colonoscopy, pt started to gain weight everyday and was net_x000D_
positive daily.  Pt was refractory to standing IV Lasix and_x000D_
Diuril.  She got PICC line placed under IR and Natrecor gtt was_x000D_
started with still net positive daily.  Lasix gtt was added and_x000D_
was titrated up to 10-15mg/hr which gave some reponse initially_x000D_
but again became refractory to it.  Dopamine gtt was tried but_x000D_
showed no improvement in UOP.  Pt lost PICC access.  However one_x000D_
day, she started to respond extremely well with lasix gtt at_x000D_
10mg/hr and IV Diuril 250 mg [**Hospital1 **] only (without Natrecor).  Pt's_x000D_
admission weight was 130 kg (128 kg in a clinic note) and has_x000D_
gotten up as high as 139 kg.  However, she was able to diuresis_x000D_
1-2L/day and her weight came down to 130kg which is her_x000D_
baseline.  The diuretics were changed to po form (Lasix po 120_x000D_
mg [**Hospital1 **] and Diuril po 125 mg [**Hospital1 **]) and pt continued to diuresis_x000D_
with net negative daily.  Pt's CHF was thought to be possibly_x000D_
from AS.  If that is the case, valve replacement could improve_x000D_
her symtoms. Review of the aortic valve orifice and_x000D_
consideration of valve replacement should be discussed as_x000D_
outpatient.  Pt needs to follow up with a [**Hospital 1902**] clinic within 1_x000D_
week._x000D_
_x000D_
3) Afib: Pt with hx of atrial fibrillation but now in sinus_x000D_
rhythm. Rate is bradycardic. Pt noted to have pauses on tele up_x000D_
to 2 seconds. Pt was continued on amiodarone 200 mg po qd._x000D_
Coumadin was held in a setting of GI bleed and also for high INR_x000D_
prior to colonoscopy.  Coumadin was restarted with goal INR of_x000D_
[**1-2**].  Pt needs to be seen by her PCP to check her INR level._x000D_
_x000D_
4) COPD/restrictive lung dz: Pt was continued on 2 L of oxygen_x000D_
which is her baseline.  Pt was getting nebulizer prn for_x000D_
wheezing and SOB.  Pt is on home O2._x000D_
_x000D_
5) DM: Pt was initially continued on home meds of avandia and_x000D_
glyburide and was cover with RISS.  However, avandia was held_x000D_
while she was NPO.  She will be discharged with her home_x000D_
regimen._x000D_
_x000D_
9) CODE: DNR/ DNI- this was re-discussed with patient and_x000D_
husband to determine if pt still wants to be DNI/DNR as she has_x000D_
been DNR/DNI on prior admissions._x000D_

requiring admissions, and a recent admission for cellulitis who_x000D_
presents with seven days of diarrhea and found to be_x000D_
hypotensive, meeting code sepsis criteria. Pt was recently_x000D_
admitted to [**Hospital1 **] from [**Date range (3) 20690**] with a left lower extremity_x000D_
cellulitis treated with unasyn transitioned to augmentin as an_x000D_
outpt. She took the augmentin for 11 days post-discharge with_x000D_
last being ~[**2172-6-9**]. Pt says that for the last seven days she_x000D_
has had profuse diarrhea (two days per husband), last today with_x000D_
3 episodes. No blood or melena noted. She denies any_x000D_
lightheadedness/ fever/ chills/ nausea/ vomiting or chest pain._x000D_
She has had decreased PO intake for many days (could not_x000D_

Brief Hospital Course:_x000D_
Pt is a 73 yo Ukranian female with MMP who presents with_x000D_
hypotension, despite fluid resuscitation, and with diarrhea._x000D_
_x000D_
She initially required pressors (epinephrine).  After more_x000D_
aggressive IVF use, she was able to be weaned off pressors._x000D_
During this time, she was also changed from flagyl to PO_x000D_
vancomycin (for positive c. diff colitis), given her initial_x000D_
lack of progress.  During this time, her SBPs were in the 90s,_x000D_
often dropping to the 70s systolic.  Her initial acute on_x000D_
chronic renal failure improved over the first few days.  After_x000D_
this initial improvement, her course began to worsen again.  Her_x000D_
blood pressures again required pressor support (despite IVF),_x000D_
her WBC began to increase (with 14% bands) and her blood gas_x000D_
showed a worsening acidemia.  Her urine culture grew_x000D_
enterococcus.  Treatment with vanc and flagyl for c. diff and_x000D_
gent/cefepine for UTI were begun.  Despite this, she required_x000D_
more pressor support and her respirations became less strong._x000D_
She expired at 5:59 pm on [**2172-6-22**]._x000D_

_x000D_
 CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: There is suboptimal opacification of the_x000D_
 pulmonary arteries due to suboptimal timing of the contrast bolus.  There is_x000D_
 no evidence of discrete filling defects within the main branches of the_x000D_
 pulmonary arteries.  Again seen is prominence of the pulmonary artery_x000D_
 measuring 3.2 cm,   Again seen are several small mediastinal and hilar lymph_x000D_
 nodes, some of which appear tatty replaced and others appear calcified.  They_x000D_
 are stable in size and number compared to a yeare ago.  Also noted is_x000D_
 mediastinal lipomatosis.  There are tiny bilateral pleural effusions.  Also_x000D_
 noted is increased septal line thickening throughout both lungs, clearly_x000D_
 increased compared to prior examination.  The images are slightly degraded due_x000D_
 to motion, but there appears to be bilateral subtle ground glass opacity._x000D_

 INDICATION:  CHF, chronic renal insufficiency, need for IV dopamine and_x000D_
 diuretics.  Could not get bedside PICC._x000D_
_x000D_
 PROCEDURE/FINDINGS:  The procedure was performed by Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 2581**] and_x000D_
 [**Name5 (PTitle) 179**], the staff radiologist who was present and supervising.  The left upper_x000D_
 arm was prepped and draped in the standard sterile fashion.  Since no suitable_x000D_
 superficial veins were visible, ultrasound was used for localization for a_x000D_
 suitable vein.  The left basilic vein was patent and compressible.  After_x000D_
 local anesthesia with 3 cc of 1% lidocaine, the basilic vein was entered under_x000D_
 ultrasonographic guidance with a 21 gauge micropuncture needle.  A 0.018_x000D_
 guidewire was advanced under fluoroscopy into the superior vena cava.  Based_x000D_
 on the markers on the guidewire, it was determined that a length of 44 cm will_x000D_
 be suitable.  The PICC line was trimmed to length and advanced over a 4 FR_x000D_
 introducer sheath under fluoroscopic guidance into the superior vena cava. The_x000D_
 sheath was removed.  The catheter was flushed.  A final chest x-ray was_x000D_
 obtained.  The film demonstrates the tip to be in the superior vena cava just_x000D_
 above the atrium.  The line is ready for use.  A Statlock was applied and the_x000D_
 line heplocked._x000D_

_x000D_
 INDICATION:  Diabetic foot, cellulitis in left ankle with pain, swelling_x000D_
 especially medial malleolus, evaluate for osteoarthritis._x000D_
_x000D_
 FINDINGS:  AP, oblique and lateral view of the left ankle demonstrate diffuse_x000D_
 soft tissue swelling but absence of any acute skeletal trauma.  The position_x000D_
 of the talus in the mortise is anatomic.  No significant degenerative changes_x000D_
 can be identified, however, the soft tissue swelling surrounding the ankle_x000D_
 joint makes detail assessment difficult._x000D_
_x000D_
 The lateral view confirms the edematous soft tissue swelling and discloses the_x000D_
 presence of rather advanced arterial wall calcifications both in dorsalis_x000D_
 pedis and posterior tibial artery area.  There exists a half cm planter heel_x000D_
 spur and mild contour irregularities in the dorsal aspect of the foot_x000D_
 consistent with some osteoarthritis.  The major joint spaces, however, appear_x000D_
 preserved.  AP, oblique and lateral view of the left foot also exclude the_x000D_
 presence of an acute skeletal injury.  Degenerative changes in the form of_x000D_
 joint distance reduction exists in the first metatarsophalangeal joint area_x000D_
 with contour irregularities of the joint surfaces and increased sclerosis in_x000D_
 the adjacent skeletal structures.  No significant hallux valgus deformity is_x000D_
 present.  Moderate degree of hammer toe deformities are seen in the distal_x000D_
 phalanges most marked in the third, fourth and fifth toe.  The tarsophalangeal_x000D_
 joint and internal tarsal joints appear quite well preserved with only minor_x000D_
 degenerative changes._x000D_
_x000D_
 There exists no prior similar study in our records available for comparison._x000D_

with ? symptomatic seizures who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] ED on_x000D_
[**2161-5-2**] at 5pm as a transfer from [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital for_x000D_
evaluation of left temporal intraparenchymal hemorrhage._x000D_
_x000D_
He was in his usual state of health until earlier today. Per his_x000D_
wife, he went to get a haircut this morning and returned home at_x000D_
noon. When he went to talk to his wife, his words came out as_x000D_
gibberish. The words themselves were not slurred but it was like_x000D_
he was using totally inappropriate words. He seemed frustrated_x000D_
to_x000D_
her. She did not note any facial or limb weakness._x000D_
_x000D_
She drove him by car to [**Hospital 1562**] hospital. He walked into the_x000D_
hospital of his own [**Location (un) **]. Head CT showed a left temporal lobar_x000D_
hemorrhage, widest diameter of 2.5 cm present on three 5 mm_x000D_
cuts._x000D_
His INR was 2.5. He received Vitamin K and 4 units of FFP. After_x000D_
the fourth unit of FFP, he developed [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] red rash over his_x000D_
entire body. An additional two units of FFP had been ordered but_x000D_
were held due to concern for transfusion reaction._x000D_
_x000D_
On arrival here, he was bradycardic to the 30s with a 208/79. He_x000D_
was examined here off of sedation and was noted to move all_x000D_
extremities symmetrically. While in [**Hospital1 18**] ED, received 50 mg_x000D_
Benadryl IV (for rash), was bolused with Propofol and started on_x000D_
Propofol drip, and loaded with 1 gram of IV Dilantin. For repeat_x000D_
of INR 1.8, he was ordered for another 2 units FFP after getting_x000D_
Solumedrol 125 mg IV and Pepcid 20 mg IV._x000D_
_x000D_
He was seen by Neurosurgery who felt that surgical intervention_x000D_
was not warranted at this time._x000D_

CT without contrast [**5-2**]_x000D_
TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast head CT._x000D_
_x000D_
FINDINGS: There is a focal rounded area of hyperattenuation_x000D_
measuring 2.5 x 2.3 cm in the left frontoparietal region_x000D_
consistent with intraparenchymal hemorrhage, relatively_x000D_
unchanged in appearance from the outside films. There is a thin_x000D_
hypodense halo consistent with surrounding edema. There is no_x000D_
evidence of mass effect, shift of normally midline structures or_x000D_
hydrocephalus. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation is_x000D_
preserved. Note is made of extensive mucosal thickening within_x000D_
the visualized maxillary and ethmoid sinuses bilaterally. The_x000D_
mastoid air cells are well aerated. Bone windows demonstrate no_x000D_
evidence of acute fracture or osseous lesion._x000D_
_x000D_
IMPRESSION: 2.5 cm intraparenchymal hemorrhage within the left_x000D_
frontoparietal region with associated edema. No evidence of_x000D_
hydronephrosis, midline shift or mass effect. Extensive mucosal_x000D_
thickening within the visualized portions of the paranasal_x000D_
sinuses as described above._x000D_

PRELIMINARY REPORT: Exam is extremely technically limited by_x000D_
suboptimal contrast bolus. Within the limits of the study, the_x000D_
major vessels of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**] appear patent. There is a_x000D_
dominant left vertebral artery. Left intraparenchymal hemorrhage_x000D_
is again seen. Full [**Location (un) 1131**] to follow after post-processed_x000D_
images are acquired. Wet [**Location (un) 1131**] to CCC at 9:50 p.m. on_x000D_
[**2161-5-2**]. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], pager [**Numeric Identifier 21129**]._x000D_
_x000D_
FINDINGS: Study is extremely limited by suboptimal contrast_x000D_
bolus, which precludes evaluation of the intracranial_x000D_
circulation. No gross abnormalities are identified. There is a_x000D_
dominant left vertebral artery, with a possible posterior_x000D_
inferior cerebellar artery termination of the right vertebral_x000D_
artery. If clinically warranted, a repeat study could be_x000D_
performed for further evaluation._x000D_

CHEST, SINGLE PORTABLE VIEW: Comparison is made to [**2159-10-25**], a CT and radiograph. The tip of the endotracheal tube lies_x000D_
10 cm above the carina, above the thoracic inlet. The heart is_x000D_
enlarged. The pulmonary artery is again prominent. A rounded_x000D_
opacity in the right hilum most likely also represents a_x000D_
pulmonary artery. There is opacity obscuring the left_x000D_
hemidiaphragm, which may represent atelectasis. There is no_x000D_
evidence of pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The left_x000D_
cardiophrenic angle is excluded._x000D_
Old healed right rib fracture._x000D_
_x000D_
IMPRESSION:_x000D_
1. More proximal than ideal positioning of endotracheal tube,_x000D_
above the thoracic inlet. This finding was discussed with Dr._x000D_
[**Last Name (STitle) **] in the ER shortly after the study._x000D_

3. Cardiomegaly._x000D_
_x000D_
[**5-3**] MRI:_x000D_
Multiplanar MRI imaging without and with gadolinium was_x000D_
performed. Sequences included axial T1, T2, FLAIR, gradient-echo_x000D_
images. Sagittal T1- weighted images were also obtained. After_x000D_
administration of gadolinium, sagittal, axial, and coronal_x000D_
T1-weighted images were obtained. MRA of the brain was also_x000D_
performed. Axial 3D multiplanar time-of-flight images were_x000D_
displayed._x000D_
_x000D_
MRI OF THE BRAIN WITHOUT AND WITH GADOLINIUM: There is again_x000D_
noted a left parietal hemorrhage, which measures 2.5 x 2.2 cm_x000D_
and is probably unchanged when compared to CT performed on the_x000D_
prior day. There is a moderate amount of edema around the_x000D_
hemorrhage. There is no evidence of shift of midline structures_x000D_
or herniations. After administration of gadolinium, there is no_x000D_
evidence of abnormal enhancement in the area to suggest_x000D_
underlying tumor. There are no other areas of susceptibility_x000D_
artifact present throughout the brain. No other obvious areas of_x000D_
hemorrhage, acute or chronic hemorrhages are seen. The_x000D_
ventricles are of normal size, which is unchanged when compared_x000D_
to prior study. There are again noted multiple areas of_x000D_
increased T2-weighted signal in the periventricular white_x000D_
matter, likely representing chronic microvascular infarcts._x000D_
_x000D_
There is again noted moderate-to-severe opacification of the_x000D_
bilateral maxillary sinuses with mucosal thickening likely a_x000D_
retention cyst in the right maxillary sinus. There is also_x000D_
moderate opacification of the ethmoid cells and mild mucosal_x000D_
thickening of the sphenoid sinuses. There is also mild mucosal_x000D_
thickening of the frontal sinuses bilaterally._x000D_
_x000D_
MRA of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**]: The major tributaries of the circle_x000D_
of [**Location (un) 431**] are patent. There is no area of significant stenosis_x000D_
or aneurysmal dilatation. Within the limits of coverage of this_x000D_
study, no sign of arteriovenous malformation is apparent._x000D_
_x000D_
IMPRESSION:_x000D_
_x000D_
1. Intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the left upper lobe appears to_x000D_
be unchanged when compared to prior study. No evidence of_x000D_
abnormal enhancement to suggest an underlying tumor. Within the_x000D_
limits of coverage of the study, no sign of aneurysmal_x000D_
malformations apparent._x000D_

EEG [**5-3**]:_x000D_
FINDINGS:_x000D_
ABNORMALITY #1: The background is low voltage and slow in the_x000D_
delta_x000D_
frequency range with bursts of moderate voltage generalized_x000D_
slowing_x000D_
bifrontally predominant with superimposed fast activity. There_x000D_
are_x000D_
bursts of moderate slowing in the delta frequency range_x000D_
bifrontally_x000D_
predominant._x000D_
BACKGROUND: As above._x000D_
HYPERVENTILATION: Could not be performed because the patient was_x000D_
_x000D_
intubated._x000D_
INTERMITTENT PHOTIC STIMULATION: Was not performed because this_x000D_
was a_x000D_
portable study._x000D_
SLEEP: Normal transitions of the sleep architecture were not_x000D_
seen._x000D_
CARDIAC MONITOR: Irregular bradycardia with a rate range between_x000D_
36-48_x000D_
bpm._x000D_
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal routine EEG due to the presence_x000D_
of low_x000D_
voltage and slow background activity in the delta frequency_x000D_
range with_x000D_
bursts of generalized slowing bifrontally predominant. This_x000D_
finding_x000D_
represents a severe encephalopathy most likely due to the_x000D_
medication_x000D_
effect. There were no clear epileptiform discharges recorded. An_x000D_
_x000D_
irregular bradycardia was noted._x000D_

REPEAT HEAD CT [**5-4**]:_x000D_
COMPARISON: Head CT dated [**2161-5-4**]._x000D_
_x000D_
TECHNIQUE: MDCT-acquired images of the head were obtained_x000D_
without IV contrast._x000D_
_x000D_
FINDINGS: Left temporal intraparenchymal hemorrhage with_x000D_
surrounding hypodensity of the brain parenchyma is not_x000D_
significantly changed compared to the previous study, measuring_x000D_
24 x 25 mm. No definite new foci of hemorrhage are seen. The_x000D_
ventricles are stable in size. There is no midline shift. Basal_x000D_
cisterns appear patent. The osseous structures and sinuses are_x000D_
not significantly changed._x000D_
_x000D_
IMPRESSION: No significant interval change compared to the study_x000D_
performed eleven hours prior._x000D_
_x000D_
REPEAT CXR [**5-4**]:_x000D_
FINDINGS: Patient is status post intubation, the ET tube is_x000D_
located 5.1 cm above the carina. Otherwise, the chest radiograph_x000D_
is unchanged. Dobbhoff overlies the stomach. The cardiac and_x000D_
mediastinal contours are stable. Patchy areas of increased_x000D_
opacification in the retrocardiac and right infrahilar region_x000D_
are unchanged._x000D_
_x000D_
IVC FILTER PLACED:_x000D_
PROCEDURE AND DETAIL: The patient was brought into the_x000D_
interventional suite and placed in a supine position. After he_x000D_
was adequately sedated per nursing, he was prepped and draped in_x000D_
the normal sterile manner. Retrograde right common femoral_x000D_
venous access was obtained using a 19-gauge single wall puncture_x000D_
needle, a 0.035 starter wire, and a 4-French sheath. The tip of_x000D_
the 4 French sheath was placed into the femoral vein and an_x000D_
iliac venogram was obtained. Over the [**Last Name (un) 21130**] wire, the sheath_x000D_
was then advanced into the iliac system after confirming there_x000D_
is no evidence of thrombus and an inferior vena cavogram was_x000D_
obtained._x000D_
_x000D_
At this time, the sheath was changed over a wire for a 6 FR_x000D_
sheath which was positioned 1.5 cm distal to the origin of the_x000D_
lowest renal vein. The vena cava was then measured on venogram_x000D_
and found to be ___ exactly 30 mm in diameter in its infrarenal_x000D_
portion. We chose the OptEase IVC filter at this time. It was_x000D_
loaded into the 6 French sheath and deployed atraumatically 1.5_x000D_
cm distal to the renal veins. The sheath was pulled and a static_x000D_
view of the filter and its position was obtained. A venogram was_x000D_
then obtained following placement of the filter. It was in_x000D_
excellent position, without evidence of tilt._x000D_
_x000D_
At this time, all catheters, wires and sheaths were removed and_x000D_
the access site was sealed with direct pressure. The patient_x000D_
tolerated the procedure well and was taken to the recovery room_x000D_
in stable condition. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was present and scrubbed for_x000D_
the entire procedure and fluoroscopy was utilized._x000D_
_x000D_
VENOGRAPHIC FINDINGS: There is a widely patent right common_x000D_
iliac vein. There is some reflux into the left common iliac_x000D_
vein. There is brisk forward flow. There is a widely patent_x000D_
inferior vena cava that is approximately 30 mm in diameter in_x000D_
its infrarenal portion. There is no evidence of thrombus in the_x000D_
right iliac vein or the inferior vena cava. We clearly see the_x000D_
renal veins at the mid L2. We see deployment and atraumatic_x000D_
placement of an OptEase recoverable IVC filter 1.5 cm distal to_x000D_
the lowest renal vein at L3._x000D_

REPEAT CXR [**5-9**]:_x000D_
There has been placement of a tracheostomy tube which terminates_x000D_
in the tracheal lumen at the thoracic inlet level. There is no_x000D_
pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum. Cardiac and mediastinal_x000D_
contours are stable. There is improving aeration at both lung_x000D_
bases with residual patchy and linear atelectasis. Gastric_x000D_
distention is observed in the imaged portion of the upper_x000D_
abdomen._x000D_

KUB [**5-12**]:_x000D_
FINDINGS: There is evidence of dilated loops of large bowel._x000D_
There is an unusual appearance to the bowel in the right upper_x000D_
quadrant, concerning for cecal bascule. Study is limited as the_x000D_
entire abdomen is not imaged. Repeat films with decubitus and_x000D_

Brief Hospital Course:_x000D_
75 year old right handed man with past medical history coronary_x000D_
artery disease status post inferior MI, status post cath [**10-19**]_x000D_
with mild LAD disease, history of pulmonary embolus, history of_x000D_
DVT on heparin SC so on lifelong coumadin, who presented with_x000D_
episode of non-sensical speech consistent with a Wernicke's type_x000D_
aphasia. Outside hospital imaging shows a left temporal_x000D_
hemorrhage, with etiology for hemorrhage considered either_x000D_
spontaneous bleed with no underlying pathology, related to_x000D_
coumadin, or amyloid angiopathy exacerbated by coumadin.  There_x000D_
were no microhemorrhages suggestive of amyloid, but the location_x000D_
in the cortex suggested this diagnosis._x000D_
_x000D_
Hospital course:_x000D_
1. Neuro:_x000D_
-He was inbubated for airway protection and admitted to the ICU_x000D_
with q1hour neuro checks.  As his exam stabilized (when examined_x000D_
off propofol), neuro checks were liberalized._x000D_
-He was reversed with FFP to achieve a goal INR<1.4; his_x000D_
platelets remained > 100, and hct> 30.  Systolic blood pressure_x000D_
was kept within goal of 100-150 systolic._x000D_
-Imaging was performed to look for an underlying lesion; MRA was_x000D_
unrevealing of vascular anomaly, and MRI with gado showed no_x000D_
enhancement at the area of the bleed.  He should have imaging_x000D_
repeated in [**5-21**] weeks from the date of admission._x000D_
-EEG was performed, which revealed encephalopathy, with no_x000D_
epileptiform activity._x000D_
-Although there were no clinical signs to suggest seizure, he_x000D_
had been dilantin loaded and maintained on dilantin for the_x000D_
location of the bleed being cortical and potentially a seizure_x000D_
focus.  After approximately ten days, with no seizure activity,_x000D_
this was weaned off._x000D_
-At ten days following the bleed, for both cardiac and_x000D_
neuro-protection ASA 81 mg was started._x000D_
-Exam remained stable when the patient was off propofol, but_x000D_
seemed to reveal some mild right hemiparesis in comparison to_x000D_
the left side; without passey-muir valve, speech and language_x000D_
was difficult to assess.  However, his naming of both low- and_x000D_
high-frequency objects (patient mouthed words) seemed to be_x000D_
intact.  Follows only midline commands_x000D_
_x000D_
2. Heme:_x000D_
-As he was no longer a coumadin candidate, an IVC filter was_x000D_
placed [**2161-5-4**].  He was continued on pneumoboots for the_x000D_
remainder of the hospitalization._x000D_
_x000D_
3. Cards:_x000D_
-He ruled out for MI by enzyme, and cardiac telemetry monitoring_x000D_
was considered in the ICU._x000D_
-Echo was performed [**4-30**] and revealed some LVH, mild valvular_x000D_
disease, and normal EF; there was no clot seen in the heart._x000D_
_x000D_
4. Pulm:_x000D_
-He had been intubated for airway protection initially; within_x000D_
48 hours of intubation, extubation was attempted.  Hours later,_x000D_
he was reintubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure off the_x000D_
vent, with metabolic acidosis (pH 7.09).  He was succesful_x000D_
weaned off the ventilator [**5-20**] and has remained stable on trach_x000D_
collar for the past two days_x000D_
-To look for underlying cause of his respiratory failure, chest_x000D_
xray was performed which demonstrated pneumonia; bronchoscopy_x000D_
was also performed.  BAL fluid gram stain showed:_x000D_

-He was treated for pneumonia with vanco + levaquin and_x000D_
oxacillin; before seven days of therapy, vanco was discontinued_x000D_
and dicloxicillin had been started._x000D_
-He underwent tracheostomy placement [**5-8**]._x000D_
_x000D_
5. Endo:_x000D_
-RISS and QID finger stick blood glucose was continued while in_x000D_
the ICU._x000D_

6. ID:_x000D_
-See above for pneumonia treatment._x000D_
-For abdominal distention, c-diff was sent and was negative._x000D_
_x000D_
7. GI:_x000D_
-NGT was initiated for meds, and tube feeds were stated when the_x000D_
patient was stable.  Prevacid was also initiated._x000D_
-He had a PEG tube placed [**5-8**] along with the trach._x000D_
-He had abdominal distention around [**5-12**]; abdominal xray showed_x000D_
dilated large bowel loops and the questions of a cecal bascule._x000D_

 ANESTHESIA:  Local with sedation._x000D_
_x000D_
 PROCEDURE AND DETAIL:  The patient was brought into the interventional suite_x000D_
 and placed in a supine position.  After he was adequately sedated per nursing,_x000D_
 he was prepped and draped in the normal sterile manner.  Retrograde right_x000D_
 common femoral venous access was obtained using a 19-gauge single wall_x000D_
 puncture needle, a 0.035 starter wire, and a 4-French sheath.  The tip of the_x000D_
 4 French sheath was placed into the femoral vein and an iliac venogram was_x000D_
 obtained.  Over the [**Last Name (un) 9205**] wire, the sheath was then advanced into the iliac_x000D_
 system after confirming there is no evidence of thrombus and an inferior vena_x000D_
 cavogram was obtained._x000D_
_x000D_
 At this time, the sheath was changed over a wire for a 6 FR sheath which was_x000D_
 positioned 1.5 cm distal to the origin of the lowest renal vein.  The vena_x000D_
 cava was then measured on venogram and found to be ___ exactly 30 mm in_x000D_
 diameter in its infrarenal portion.  We chose the OptEase IVC filter at this_x000D_
 time.  It was loaded into the 6 French sheath and deployed atraumatically 1.5_x000D_

 TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar MRI imaging without and with gadolinium was performed._x000D_
 Sequences included axial T1, T2, FLAIR, gradient-echo images.  Sagittal T1-_x000D_
 weighted images were also obtained.  After administration of gadolinium,_x000D_
 sagittal, axial, and coronal T1-weighted images were obtained.  MRA of the_x000D_
 brain was also performed.  Axial 3D multiplanar time-of-flight images were_x000D_
 displayed._x000D_
_x000D_
 MRI OF THE BRAIN WITHOUT AND WITH GADOLINIUM:  There is again noted a left_x000D_
 parietal hemorrhage, which measures 2.5 x 2.2 cm and is probably unchanged_x000D_
 when compared to CT performed on the prior day.  There is a moderate amount of_x000D_
 edema around the hemorrhage.  There is no evidence of shift of midline_x000D_
 structures or herniations.  After administration of gadolinium, there is no_x000D_
 evidence of abnormal enhancement in the area to suggest underlying tumor._x000D_
 There are no other areas of susceptibility artifact present throughout the_x000D_
 brain.  No other obvious areas of hemorrhage, acute or chronic hemorrhages are_x000D_
 seen.  The ventricles are of normal size, which is unchanged when compared to_x000D_

 signal in the periventricular white matter, likely representing chronic_x000D_
 microvascular infarcts._x000D_
_x000D_
 There is again noted moderate-to-severe opacification of the bilateral_x000D_

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Baby Girl [**Known lastname **] was born to a_x000D_
30 year old gravida 4, para 3 to 4 mom with prenatal_x000D_
laboratories B positive, antibody screen negative, hepatitis_x000D_
B surface antigen negative, RPR nonreactive, Rubella immune,_x000D_
unknown Group B Streptococcus status whose pregnancy was_x000D_
complicated by preterm labor with a Cerclage placed.  She was_x000D_
on bedrest as well.  She received a full course of_x000D_
Betamethasone.  She had early labor leading to spontaneous_x000D_
vaginal delivery, rupture of membranes was one hour prior to_x000D_
delivery.  There was no fever or clinical signs of_x000D_
chorioamnionitis.  Her Apgars were 9 and 9 and her_x000D_
birthweight was 2280 gm.  She was transferred to the Newborn_x000D_
Intensive Care Unit secondary to prematurity._x000D_
_x000D_
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her admission physical examination_x000D_
revealed a very well appearing infant with an examination_x000D_
consistent with 34 weeks gestation.  Her birth weight was_x000D_
2280 gm, her head circumference 30 cm and her length was_x000D_
33.25 cm.  Head and neck examination was normal.  Chest, she_x000D_
had good breath sounds bilaterally with no crackles.  Her_x000D_
cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate and_x000D_
rhythm, no murmurs and normal femoral pulses.  Her abdomen_x000D_
was benign.  Her neurologic examination was normal._x000D_
_x000D_
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Respiratory - She has been on room air_x000D_
throughout her hospital stay.  She has had mild apnea and_x000D_
bradycardia.  Her last apneic spell with mild desaturation_x000D_
was on the evening of [**10-7**], at 11 PM._x000D_
_x000D_
Cardiovascular - She was noted to have a very mild murmur on_x000D_
day of life No. 1 but had normal forelimb extremity blood_x000D_
pressures, electrocardiogram and hyperoxia test as well as a_x000D_
chest x-ray which did not show any cardiomegaly and clear_x000D_
lung fields.  Her murmur persisted and on day of life No. 2,_x000D_
Cardiology was consulted who asked that we follow the murmur_x000D_
for a few more days and reconsult them once her pulmonary_x000D_
pressures had dropped, if the murmur had not changed.  She_x000D_
had a murmur on day of life No. 6 which revealed a small_x000D_
muscular ventricular septal defect, otherwise normal anatomy._x000D_
She will be followed up by Cardiology at one months time_x000D_
after discharge.  No intervention is thought to be needed_x000D_
given the very small size of this muscular wall defect as_x000D_
well as the likelihood that it would close on its own as she_x000D_
grows._x000D_
_x000D_
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition - She was about to p.o._x000D_
feed ad lib immediately after birth but was slow to take an_x000D_
adequate volume, so she required gavage feeding which she is_x000D_
still receiving.  She is also supplementing with_x000D_
breastfeeding and is taking about one-half to three-quarters_x000D_
per volume orally.  She has had normal urine output and_x000D_
stools.  She had normal glucoses.  He most recent weight on_x000D_
the day of interim summary was 2195 gm._x000D_
_x000D_
Gastrointestinal - She has had no history of feeding_x000D_
intolerance, spits or abdominal distention.  She had a_x000D_
bilirubin check on day of life No. 2 that was 6.8.  We_x000D_
followed this up on one on day of life No. 3 which was 8.2._x000D_
Her jaundice did not worsen and we followed it clinically_x000D_
thereafter._x000D_
_x000D_
Hematology - She had an admission hematocrit which was 43.1_x000D_
percent._x000D_
_x000D_
Infectious disease - She had an initial blood culture sent as_x000D_
well as a complete blood count which showed a white count of_x000D_
10.5, hematocrit 43.1, 314,000 platelets and differential at_x000D_
41 neutrophils, 3 bands and 45 lymphocytes.  No antibiotics_x000D_
were started._x000D_

BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient is a 52-year-old_x000D_
gentleman with liver cirrhosis secondary to chronic hepatitis_x000D_
C and long history of alcohol use, who presented to [**Hospital1 1444**] on [**2109-12-16**] for_x000D_
living related liver transplant from his son._x000D_
_x000D_
The patient was preoped in the usual standard fashion._x000D_
Procedure went without any complications.  The estimated_x000D_
blood loss from the procedure was around 2200 cc.  The_x000D_
patient did receive a variety of intraoperative fluids_x000D_
including blood products._x000D_
_x000D_
The patient was taken to the ICU for close monitoring_x000D_
postoperatively.  A postoperative day one Duplex ultrasound_x000D_
of the liver revealed a patent artery and vein.  He again_x000D_
received variable blood products including red blood cells_x000D_
for a hematocrit as low as 27.4 and six packs of platelets x3_x000D_
for a platelet count of 85 as well as a FFP for an elevated_x000D_
INR._x000D_
_x000D_
In the ICU, the patient was diuresed and weaned to_x000D_
extubation.  He was on a variety of antihypertensives.  He_x000D_
received a short course of perioperative Unasyn.  In_x000D_
addition, there was a short period of time where he was on an_x000D_
insulin drip as well as a hydrogen chloride drip for a bicarb_x000D_
of 36.  These were eventually stopped.  Patient was extubated_x000D_
on postoperative day four._x000D_
_x000D_
Another Duplex ultrasound was repeated, which was normal._x000D_
Arterial and venous wave forms were normal.  There was no_x000D_
biliary ductal dilatation.  The liver function tests_x000D_
continued to trend downward._x000D_
_x000D_
On postoperative day five, the patient was transferred to the_x000D_
floor.  Around that period, the patient had a very brief_x000D_
episode of some mild confusion.  This eventually resolved._x000D_
_x000D_
For immunosuppressant medication, the patient received during_x000D_
the hospital course a total of two doses of Simulect.  He was_x000D_
started on cyclosporin on postoperative day one.  He_x000D_
additionally was on a short Solu-Medrol taper and eventually_x000D_
was placed on p.o. prednisone._x000D_
_x000D_
His diet was slowly advanced, which he has tolerated.  A_x000D_
postoperative T tube study was done on postoperative day 10,_x000D_
which showed a size discrepancy, a question of a stenosis at_x000D_
the common bile duct at the biliary anastomosis.  It was_x000D_
thought to continue with the T tube open to gravity.  JP had_x000D_
been discontinued at this point.  A future ERCP will_x000D_
eventually be discussed with the patient in clinic.  It was_x000D_
thought that the patient was stable for discharge on_x000D_
postoperative day 12 with follow-up appointments with Dr._x000D_
[**Last Name (STitle) **] at the [**Hospital 1326**] Clinic._x000D_

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  There is a large subcapsular collection_x000D_
 of low-attenuation fluid about the right hepatic lobe posteriorly and_x000D_
 inferiorly which, given the history of recent percutaneous tube placement,_x000D_
 likely represents a biloma.  The attenuation values within this collection are_x000D_
 consistent with simple fluid.  There is a internal/external percutaneous_x000D_
 biliary stent with its pigtail in the duodenum.  There is a T-tube seen_x000D_
 traversing this collection and it exiting through the lower abdomen.  This_x000D_
 large collection is having mass effect both on the sucapsular liver and on the_x000D_
 adjacent kidney and duodenum.  The spleen remains enlarged.  There are_x000D_
 numerous splenorenal collaterals.  There are several prominent lymph nodes in_x000D_

 HISTORY: 52-year-old gentleman postop day 30 from liver transplant. T-tube_x000D_
 cholangiogram demonstrated strictures in the common bile duct._x000D_
_x000D_
 PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS: The procedure was performed by Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 1812**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 27**]_x000D_
 with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 27**] being present and supervising for the entire procedure. After_x000D_
 general anesthesia was induced the patient's abdomen was prepped and draped in_x000D_
 standard sterile fashion. Contrast was administered through the T-tube to_x000D_
 opacify the biliary system. A right posterior peripheral bile duct was_x000D_
 identified. After infusion of 1% lidocaine a 22 gauge needle was utilized to_x000D_
 access this bile duct without difficulty. An .018 glidewire was advanced_x000D_
 through the needle into the duct. The puncture needle was exchanged for a 4 Fr_x000D_
 catheter. The catheter was positioned in the proximal common bile duct and_x000D_
 cholangiogram was performed demonstrating a high-grade stricture at the_x000D_
 ampulla. The catheter was upsized to a 6 Fr sheath. Using an .035 glidewire_x000D_
 and C2 Cobra catheter the ampullary stricture was able to be bypassed and the_x000D_
 wire and catheter were advanced into the small bowel. The wire was then_x000D_
 exchanged for [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 2244**] wire. The Cobra catheter was removed and exchanged for_x000D_
 an 8 mm balloon. Th ampullary stricture was balloon-dilated with the 8 mm_x000D_
 balloon. Cholangiogram through the sheath following balloon dilatation_x000D_
 revealed a good angiographic result with passage of contrast into the_x000D_
 duodenum. The balloon and sheath were removed over the wire and an 8.5 Fr_x000D_
 biliary catheter was attempted to be advanced over the wire. Catheter was_x000D_
 unable to be advanced through the mid common bile duct around the area of T-_x000D_
 tube due to possible stricture. A 4 mm balloon was advanced over the wire into_x000D_
 the common bile duct and the duct was dilated with the 4 mm balloon both_x000D_
 inferior and superior to the T-tube. The Cobra catheter was then reinserted_x000D_
 over the wire and the wire was exchanged for an Amplatz wire. The 8.5 Fr_x000D_
 biliary catheter was then successfully advanced over the Amplatz wire. The_x000D_
 pigtail was formed in the duodenum. Followup cholangiogram demonstrated good_x000D_
 positioning of the tube with side holes in the right hepatic and common bile_x000D_

                                 FINAL REPORT_x000D_
 HISTORY: The patient had a living related liver transplant with placement of_x000D_
 an external-internal biliary drain, placement of a small catheter within a_x000D_
 left-sided biliary system, and placement of a ""biloma"" tube at the right lower_x000D_
 surface of the liver._x000D_
_x000D_
 PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed by Drs. [**First Name (STitle) 324**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 135**] with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 135**]_x000D_
 being present throughout and supervising. The small surgical tube in the left-_x000D_
 sided biliary system was first infused under gravity and a film was obtained_x000D_
 before administration of contrast followed by several sequential films. It_x000D_
 demonstrated that it was filling a left-sided ductal system and oblong space_x000D_
 which did not have any extravasation into the free peritoneum. This biliary_x000D_
 space connected with the main bile duct as evidenced by contrast flowing into_x000D_
 the hepatic duct and into the external-internal biliary tube with rapid_x000D_
 quantitative transit of contrast through the tube into the small bowel. From_x000D_
 this injection site there was no extravasation to the undersurface of the_x000D_
 liver. Of note also is that during this injection there was only faint filling_x000D_
 of the right-sided hepatic ducts indicating that there is no further pressure_x000D_
 gradient preventing emptying of the biliary system into the small bowel. Of_x000D_
 note also is that while the biliary external-internal tube becomes relatively_x000D_
 radio- opaque compatible with filling of its intrahepatic segment and system_x000D_
 extending into the small bowel the piece of tubing that at this point extended_x000D_
 externally and was not capped but draining to a bag did not fill with contrast_x000D_
 indicating good  internal drainage. After a period of about 10 minutes the_x000D_
 biliary system had drained there was still some residual contrast within the_x000D_
 oblong left-sided superior space, but again fully contained._x000D_
_x000D_
 Now the external-internal biliary tube was injected since a prior_x000D_
 cholangiogram from [**2110-1-20**] demonstrated a leak into the right subhepatic_x000D_
 space and toward the biloma drainage tube. During today's cholangiogram_x000D_
 through the external/internal drainage catheter only a very faint tract of_x000D_
 contrast into this space was observed. It was also noted that injection from_x000D_
 this side filled also the left-sided oblong-shaped biliary structure._x000D_
_x000D_
 IMPRESSION: Marked decrease in leakage from a site at the confluence of the_x000D_
 intrahepatic ductal structure. Injection from the small surgical biliary tube_x000D_
                                                             (Over)_x000D_

 which is indwelling in a left-sided biliary radical and adjacent structure_x000D_
 shows no free leakage. There is rapid drainage from that space to the bile_x000D_
 duct and through the external-internal tube into the small bowel._x000D_
_x000D_
 Considering that filling of the external-internal stent through the external_x000D_
 drainage component is still associated with some minor leakage may give rise_x000D_
 to consider how the position of the external drainage bag might be modified._x000D_
 If it should be placed too low gastrointenstinal content could drain_x000D_
 externally and possibly at a space. On the other hand decompression of the_x000D_
 entire system is still desirable._x000D_

 PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS: The procedure was performed by Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 1812**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 7**],_x000D_
 who was present and supervising. Through the patient's surgical percutaneous_x000D_
 biliary tube, a tube cholangiogram was performed under gravity. The bile ducts_x000D_
 were decompressed. The biliary tube crossed through the anatomosis and there_x000D_
 was filling seen in the jejunum. The anastomotic area and the common bile duct_x000D_
 was somewhat irregular in appearance with filling defects. There was no leak_x000D_
 observed at this location. At the medial surface there was a continued leak_x000D_
 through the peripheral duct as has been previously seen. This fills into a_x000D_
 small collection which has also been previously observed. The patient_x000D_
 tolerated the procedure well and there are no postprocedure complications._x000D_

 TECHNIQUE:  Axial CT imaging of the abdomen performed without contrast as well_x000D_
 as with arterial and portal venous phase of contrast administration._x000D_
 Additional delayed imaging of the abdomen and pelvis was performed after the_x000D_
 intravenous administration of 100 cc of Visipaque.  Visipaque was used due to_x000D_
 patient's renal dysfunction._x000D_
_x000D_
 CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH CONTRAST:  The visualized portions of the_x000D_
 lung bases are clear.  When compared to a prior study of [**2110-1-19**] there has_x000D_
 been placement of a pigtail drainage catheter in the infrahepatic region with_x000D_
 decreased size of a subhepatic fluid collection.  A percutaneous catheter_x000D_
 traversing the right abdomen and terminating within the duodenum is unchanged_x000D_
 when compared to the prior examination.  On the arterial phase of contrast_x000D_
 enhancement, no definite intrahepatic arterial flow is identified.  Arterial_x000D_
 flow is identified within the proper hepatic artery just beyond the_x000D_
 gastroduodenal artery.  The proximal celiac axis and superior mesenteric_x000D_
 arteries are well opacified.  There is no definite evidence of intrahepatic_x000D_
 biliary ductal dilatation.  On the portal venous phase there are patchy areas_x000D_
 of hypodensity within the posterior aspect of the transplant liver as well as_x000D_
 the inferior aspect of the transplant liver.  These areas of patchy_x000D_
 hypoattenuation are not as prominent on the noncontrast scan and on the late_x000D_
 phase of contrast administration.  Large varices are identified in the region_x000D_
 of the splenic hilum.  On the arterial phase of contrast administration the_x000D_
 spleen enhances to a greater degree than the liver.  The pancreas, adrenal_x000D_
 glands, kidneys, and visualized portions of large and small bowel are_x000D_
 unremarkable._x000D_

 FINDINGS: Initial scout view demonstrates presence of a T-tube, right-sided_x000D_

 TECHNIQUE AND FINDINGS:  The patient is s/p hepaticojejunostomy.  Indwelling_x000D_
 internal/external drainage catheter is in place, traversing the anastomosis. A_x000D_
 guidewire was advanced through the catheter and the catheter removed.  A 5_x000D_
 French sheath was then placed.  Small amount of contrast material was injected_x000D_
 and demonstrated extensive leak at the anastomosis.  A second guidewire was_x000D_
 placed through the sheath and the sheath was then removed.  One wire was left_x000D_
 for safety and the sheath was then introduced into the biliary tree over the_x000D_
 second guidewire.  A microcatheter was used to cannulate a small branch of the_x000D_
 common duct.  With the help of a wire a microcatheter was advanced to the very_x000D_
 periphery of this small duct in the medial and superior portion of the liver._x000D_
 A small amount of contrast was injected through the microcatheter and_x000D_
 demonstrated a second point of leak into the same collection, which was_x000D_
 opacified from the leak at the hepaticojejunostomy anastomosis.  Gelfoam_x000D_
 slurry was injected into the peripheral aspect of this duct through the_x000D_
 microcatheter.  The microcatheter was then moved back and injection of_x000D_
 contrast material demonstrated no evidence of a persistent leak.  A_x000D_
 microcatheter was then removed.  The sheath was also then removed and biliary_x000D_

 with common bile duct leak.  Has percutaneous 12-French drain but continues to_x000D_
 leak out of side holes into the fluid collection._x000D_
_x000D_
 PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  The procedure was performed by Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 1812**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 7**]_x000D_
 who was present and supervising throughout.  The patient's right abdomen was_x000D_
 prepped and draped in standard sterile fashion.  1% Lidocaine was infused_x000D_
 around the tube exit site.  The existing 12-French biliary tube was examined_x000D_
 under fluoroscopy and found to be in good position.  Cholangiogram was_x000D_
 performed which demonstrated a decompressed biliary tree with the stent leak_x000D_
 at the common bile duct anastomosis.  A 12-French nephrostomy tube was_x000D_
 obtained.  Three large side holes were cut at the distal [**1-18**] of the tube.  The_x000D_
 existing biliary tube was cut and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 414**] wire was advanced into the bowel._x000D_
 The biliary tube was removed.  The modified 12-French nephrostomy tube was_x000D_
 advanced over the wire.  The wire and innder stiffner were removed.  The_x000D_
 pigtail was formed and locked.  The tube was positioned such that no side_x000D_
 holes were present at the leak.  Post placement tube nephrostogram confirmed_x000D_
 good positioning of the tube with proxmal side holes in the biliary tree,_x000D_
 distal side holes in the bowel.  There was no extravasation of contrast at the_x000D_
 leak.  The catheter was secured with an O silk suture and a flexi-track.  A_x000D_
 mark was made with a permanent marker at the desired skin exit site of the_x000D_
 tube to ensure that there re no side holes at the anastomotic leak.  The tube_x000D_
 was then attached to bag drainage.  The patient tolerated the procedure well_x000D_
 and there were no immediate post procedure complications._x000D_

                                 FINAL REPORT_x000D_
 INDICATION:  Known bile leak at hepaticojejunal anastomosis.  The patient has_x000D_
 had decreased output through the internal and external biliary drain and_x000D_
 increased output through the patient's surgically placed J-drain._x000D_
_x000D_
 CONSENT:  The risks and benefits of the proposed procedure were explained to_x000D_
 the patient.  Written informed consent was obtained and placed on the_x000D_
 patient's chart._x000D_
_x000D_
 SEDATION:  Conscious sedation was provided by the radiology nurses. Continuous_x000D_
 heart rate, blood pressure, pulse oximetry monitoring was performed.  Fentanyl_x000D_
 and Versed were administered in divided doses._x000D_
_x000D_
 PROCEDURE:  The patient was brought to the angiography suite and placed supine_x000D_
 on the table.  His internal and external biliary drain was aspirated and only_x000D_
 1.5 cc of bile could be obtained.  Tube cholangiogram with 4 cc of Optiray_x000D_
 contrast showed contrast passage through the proximal ports of the tube which_x000D_
 track down the common bile duct and into the area of known anastomotic leak._x000D_
 Subsequently, it was decided to attempt to pass a wire through the tube to see_x000D_
 if there was a clog.  A 0.035 [**Last Name (un) 2244**] wire was easily advanced through the tip_x000D_
 of the tube into the jejunum.  At this time, it was thought that perhaps the_x000D_
 end holes were clogged.  The indwelling tube was a modified nephrostomy tube_x000D_
 and the holes are small.  Therefore, the current tube was removed over the_x000D_
 [**Last Name (un) 2244**] wire.  Inspection of the tube showed that the distal holes were indeed_x000D_
 clogged.  It was decided to [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] tube with large holes both proximally_x000D_
 and distally.  A 12-French nephrostomy tube was modified with an 11 blade_x000D_
 scalpel such that large holes would be present both proximal and distal to_x000D_
 anastomotic leak.  We used the prior tube to determine the placement of the_x000D_
 holes on the current tube.  The modified tube was advanced over the [**Last Name (un) 2244**]_x000D_
 wire such that the tip lay within the jejunum.  The proximal holes are seen to_x000D_
 be within the intrahepatic common duct and the distal holes are seen to be_x000D_
 within the jejunum.  A final cholangiogram was obtained showing passage of_x000D_
 contrast into the jejunum.  The tube was sutured in place with 0-silk sutures_x000D_
 and also with a Flexitrak._x000D_

 Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) 325**] (staff radiologist) present and supervising._x000D_
_x000D_
 PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS: The patient was placed supine on the angiography_x000D_
 table. His right upper arm was prepped in sterile fashion. Since no suitable_x000D_
 superficial veins were visible, ultrasound was used for localization of a_x000D_
 suitable vein. The basilic vein was patent and compressible. After local_x000D_
 anesthesia with 1% Lidocaine, the basilic vein was entered under_x000D_
 ultrasonographic guidance with a 21 gauge needle. An 0.018 guidewire was_x000D_
 advanced under fluoroscopy into the superior vena cava (SVC). Based on the_x000D_
 markers on the guidewire it was determined that a length of 32 cm would be_x000D_
 suitable. The PICC line was trimmed to length and advanced over a 4 French_x000D_
 introducer sheath under fluoroscopic guidance into the SVC. The sheath was_x000D_
 removed. The catheter was flushed. A final chest x- ray was obtained. The film_x000D_
 demonstrates the tip to be in the SVC just above the atrium. A Stat-Lock was_x000D_
 applied and the line was hep-locked. The line is ready for use._x000D_

_x000D_
 PROCEDURE/TECHNIQUE:  Informed, written consent was obtained.  The right flank_x000D_
 and indwelling Silastic catheter were prepped and draped in the usual sterile_x000D_
 fashion.  The catheter was injected.  This demonstrated the catheter to be_x000D_
 within the biliary tree.  There was prompt filling of the biliary tree._x000D_
 Contrast flowed freely into a wide anastomotic leak.  Contrast filled within_x000D_
 this collection and was seen moving into the JP type drain._x000D_
_x000D_
 At this point the extensive suture material was removed.  An 035 angled_x000D_
 glidewire was then passed through the Silastic catheter into the roux limb._x000D_
 The Silastic catheter was removed and exchanged for a 6 French angiographic_x000D_
 sheath.  A Kumpe catheter was advanced over the glidewire.  The glidewire was_x000D_
 then exchanged for a 035 [**Last Name (un) 414**] wire.  The catheter was removed and a second_x000D_
 [**Last Name (un) 414**] wire was advanced into the central biliary system.  The angiographic_x000D_
 sheath was then exchanged and readvanced over the wire located within the_x000D_
 central biliary tree.  The second wire within the roux limb was secured and_x000D_
 used as a safety wire.  An antegrade cholangiogram was then performed through_x000D_
 the sheath.  This demonstrated a wide leak at the anastomosis.  The peripheral_x000D_
 leaking duct could not be identified.  This is felt to be related to a steal_x000D_
 phenomenon caused by the free flow of contrast from the anastomotic leak into_x000D_
 the extrahepatic bile collection.  Multiple attempts were made attempting to_x000D_
 opacify the peripheral leaking duct.  These were mostly unsuccessful.  Only_x000D_
 the proximal portion could be opacified by placing the Kumpe catheter near the_x000D_
 anastomosis and injecting contrast.  Attempts were made at selecting this duct_x000D_
 using an 035 angled glidewire, an 018 wire, renegade catheter and a Kumpe_x000D_
 catheter as well as a 4 French C2 catheter.  These were all unsuccessful._x000D_
 Other visualized ducts were selected out with the renegade catheter and_x000D_
 contrast was injected to confirm that these ducts were not the peripheral duct_x000D_
 that was leaking._x000D_

 CT OF ABDOMEN WITHOUT & WITH IV CONTRAST:  There is an internal-external_x000D_
 biliary drain entering through the right portion of the liver.  There is also_x000D_
 a surgical drain entering the porta hepatis with a small amount of gas around_x000D_
 its distal portion.  There is no fluid collection in the porta hepatis.  There_x000D_
 is  moderate amount of ascites that remains distributed throughout the_x000D_
 abdomen, thouth less than on the prior study.  Portions of this appear to be_x000D_
 loculating in the right lower quadrant with enhancing rims.  The liver itself_x000D_
 enhances uniformly.  The intrahepatic vessels appear patent, though the portal_x000D_
 vein in the porta hepatis is difficult to identify, which may relate to_x000D_
 artifact from the adjacent drain or which may imply that it is somewhat_x000D_
 narrowed, perhaps at the anastamosis-- an appearance which is unchanged.  The_x000D_
 extrahepatic portal vein proximal to he porta hepatis is patent, as is the_x000D_
 splenic vein. There are very large splenorenal varices persisting.  There is_x000D_
 persistent splenomegaly as well. There are scattered small lymph nodes_x000D_
 throughout the mesentery and retroperitoneum, not significantly changed. There_x000D_
 is a fair amount of stool throughout the colon, and there is small bowel_x000D_
 dilatation with smooth wall thickening.  This appearance is consistent with_x000D_
 ileus.  The kidneys themselves are unremarkable and the adrenal glands and_x000D_
 pancreas are within normal limits. There is no free air._x000D_

                                 FINAL REPORT_x000D_
 HISTORY: 53-year-old male status post liver transplant with right TTBD_x000D_
 catheter. Catheter has been leaking copious amounts of fluid around the exit_x000D_
 site. Please perform cholangiogram with possible catheter exchange._x000D_
_x000D_
 PROCEDURE/FINDINGS: The procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 411**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 412**] and Dr._x000D_
 [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2091**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 27**]. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 27**], the staff radiologist, was present and supervising_x000D_
 throughout. After the risks and benefits of the procedure were discussed with_x000D_
 the patient and informed consent was obtained, the patient was placed supine_x000D_
 on the angiography table. His abdomen including the existing catheter was_x000D_
 prepped and draped in the standard sterile fashion. The skin and subcutaneous_x000D_
 tissues surrounding the catheter were anesthetized with 10 cc of 1% lidocaine._x000D_
 A fluoroscopic spot image was obtained, demonstrating the catheter tip to be_x000D_
 withdrawn as compared with the prior film from [**2110-9-9**]. Tube_x000D_
 cholangiogram was then performed using 10 cc of hand-injected  contrast. This_x000D_
 demonstrated that the holes at the distal portion of the catheter were fluted_x000D_
 as contrast flowed through the proximal side holes into the right hepatic duct_x000D_
 and the jejunal loop. As compared with previous tube cholangiograms, the right_x000D_
 hepatic duct was significantly more dilated. The catheter was then cut_x000D_
 releasing the pigtail. A .035 [**Doctor Last Name 8**] wire was advanced through the exiting_x000D_
 catheter into the jejunum under fluoroscopy. The catheter was removed. A 5 Fr_x000D_
 C2 Cobra catheter was then advanced over the guide wire into the proximal_x000D_
 jejunum. The guide wire was then removed and hand injection of 10 cc of_x000D_
 contrast confirmed the position of the catheter within the jejunum beyond the_x000D_
 surgical anastomosis. A .035 [**Location (un) 1406**] J-wire was then advanced into the jejunum_x000D_
 through the 5 Fr C2 Cobra catheter. The catheter was removed. A 10 Fr biliary_x000D_
 catheter was advanced over the guide wire into the jejunum. The guide wire was_x000D_
 removed. The pigtail was formed and locked in the jejunum beyond the_x000D_
 anastomosis. Repeat cholangiography via the new 10 Fr biliary drainage_x000D_
 catheter confirmed the position of the side holes throughout the biliary tree_x000D_
 and into the jejunal loop. The contrast was aspirated and the catheter was_x000D_
 flushed with 10 cc of normal saline. The catheter was placed to external bag_x000D_
 drainage. It was secured to the skin using a #0 silk suture. A StatLock was_x000D_
 applied, followed by a dry sterile gauze dressing._x000D_

 catheter. The right hepatic duct was significantly dilated as compared with_x000D_
 previous studies. This catheter was successfully replaced with new 10 Fr_x000D_
 percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage catheter. The side holes of the_x000D_
 catheter extend throughout the biliary tree and into the jejunal loop. The_x000D_
 pigtail is formed in the jejunal loop beyond the surgical anastomosis. The_x000D_
 catheter was placed to external bag drainage. These findings were discussed_x000D_

 1_x000D_
 HISTORY:  A 53-year-old male status post [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 16279**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1280**] hepaticojejunostomy with_x000D_
 right PTBD and additional intraperitoneal [**Doctor Last Name **] drain likely through a fistula_x000D_
 tract into the jejunum.  Please perform injection of [**Doctor Last Name **] drain to assess for_x000D_
 leak or fistula._x000D_
_x000D_
 PROCEDURE/FINDINGS:  The procedure was  performed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 411**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 412**] and_x000D_
 Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2091**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 27**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 27**], the staff radiologist, was present and_x000D_
 supervising throughout.  After the risks and benefits of the procedure were_x000D_
 discussed with the patient and informed consent was obtained, the patient was_x000D_
 placed supine on the angiography table.  His abdomen, including both drains,_x000D_
 was prepped and draped in the standard sterile fashion.  Under fluoroscopic_x000D_
 visualization, 10 cc of contrast was hand injected through the [**Doctor Last Name **] drain._x000D_
 This demonstrated filling of the jejunal loop along with retrograde_x000D_
 opacification of the biliary ducts as well.  There was no evidence of_x000D_
 extravasation.  This finding was consistent with the presence of a a fistula_x000D_
 between the intraperitoneal tract and the jejunal loop.  The right PTBD_x000D_
 catheter was also present and with the pigtail formed in the jejunal loop_x000D_
 beyond the anastomosis. These findings were discussed with the transplant_x000D_
 surgery service at the time of the procedure. After a discussion with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]_x000D_
 [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 908**] from the transplant service, it was decided that the catheter would be_x000D_
 withdrawn until the tip of the [**Doctor Last Name **] drain was present outside the jejunal_x000D_
 loop. Perhaps this would allow the fistula tract to close down over time. Once_x000D_
 the [**Doctor Last Name **] drain was appropriately positioned, it was secured to the skin using_x000D_
 a 0-silk suture. Following the procedure, the bile ducts were emptied of_x000D_
 contrast. The [**Doctor Last Name **] drain was placed to bulb suction. The patient tolerated_x000D_
 the procedure well and was transferred to the recovery room following the_x000D_
 procedure in stable condition._x000D_
_x000D_
 COMPLICATIONS:  None._x000D_

 CONTRAST:  30 cc of 60% Optiray._x000D_

 IMPRESSION:  Hand injection of contrast into the intraperitoneal [**Doctor Last Name **] drain_x000D_
 demonstrated filling of the jejunal loop along with retrograde opacification_x000D_
 of the biliary tree. This study confirmed the presence of a fistula between_x000D_

 INDICATION:  Status post liver transplant with existing percutaneous biliary_x000D_
 drain with continued output.  Please assess for bile leak, catheter position_x000D_
 and biliary obstruction._x000D_
_x000D_
 PHYSICIANS:  The procedure was performed by Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 27**].  Dr._x000D_
 [**Last Name (STitle) 27**], the attending radiologist, performed the procedure after a telephone_x000D_
 discussion with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]._x000D_
_x000D_
 PROCEDURE/FINDINGS:  After explaining the risks and benefits of the procedure,_x000D_
 written informed consent was obtained. The patient was placed supine on the_x000D_
 angiography table and prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. Optiray_x000D_
 contrast material was then slowly administered under fluoroscopic guidance via_x000D_
 the existing biliary catheter.  Contrast passed freely into the Roux-en-Y_x000D_
 limb.  There was no dilatation of the intrahepatic biliary ducts or evidence_x000D_
 of leak. A 0.035 Stiff glide wire was then advanced through the existing_x000D_
 catheter and into the Roux-en-Y limb.  The skin sutures anchoring the biliary_x000D_
 drainage catheter were cut, and the tube was removed, with moderate_x000D_
 difficulty.  A 10 French Flexima biliary catheter was then advanced over the_x000D_
 wire and into the Roux-en- Y limb. The pigtail mechanism was deployed as the_x000D_
 wire was withdrawn. Injection of 5 cc of Optiray contrast confirmed tube_x000D_
 location within the Roux- en-Y limb._x000D_
_x000D_
 ANESTHESIA/MEDICATIONS:  Approximately 50 cc of Optiray contrast material was_x000D_
 used.  The patient received conscious sedation using Versed and Fentanyl, with_x000D_
 continuous hemodynamic monitoring._x000D_

                                 FINAL REPORT_x000D_
 HISTORY: 53 year old man with living-related liver transplant complicated by_x000D_
 common bile duct necrosis and hepaticojejunostomy. Patient had revision of_x000D_
 hepaticojejunostomy in 02/[**2110**]. Patient has existing percutaneous transhepatic_x000D_
 biliary drain (PTBD) in place with minimal output and [**Location (un) 1732**]-[**Location (un) 1733**] drain_x000D_
 without any output. Patient is here today for tube cholangiogram to check for_x000D_
 dilatation of bile ducts, position of the catheter, and check for any leaks._x000D_
_x000D_
 PHYSICIANS: This procedure was performed by Drs. [**First Name (STitle) 32904**] [**Name (STitle) 2243**] and_x000D_
 [**Name5 (PTitle) 737**] [**Doctor Last Name **] [**Doctor Last Name 325**] (the staff radiologist, who was present and supervising_x000D_
 throughout the procedure)._x000D_
_x000D_
 PROCEDURE/FINDINGS: The patient was placed supine on the angiography table and_x000D_
 his abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. Contrast was_x000D_
 infused slowly by gravity drainage under fluoroscopic guidance via the_x000D_
 existing biliary catheter, and cholangiograms were taken in several_x000D_
 projections (PA and obliques)._x000D_
 Contrast was passing anteriorly into a collection. There was opacification of_x000D_
 non-dilated intrahepatic biliary ducts. There was good, rapid passage of_x000D_
 contrast into the small bowel through the anastomosis._x000D_
 Compared to the prior study, there is improvement (reduction) in the size of_x000D_
 the leak and apperance of passage of contrast into the small bowel through the_x000D_
 hepaticojejunal anastomosis._x000D_
 The tube was re-connected to its external bag drainage._x000D_
_x000D_
 COMPLICATIONS: No immediate post-procedure complications were noted._x000D_
_x000D_
 ANESTHESIA/MEDICATIONS: For conscious sedation, divided doses of Versed (1 mg_x000D_
 total) and fentanyl (50 microg total) were given intravenously under_x000D_
 continuous hemodynamic monitoring. Ionic contrast (Conray 60%): 20 ml. Patient_x000D_
 was already on antibiotics (including Unasyn)._x000D_
_x000D_
 IMPRESSION: As compared to the previous study, this tube cholangiogram_x000D_
 demonstrated persistence but improvement in the size of the bile leak._x000D_

 the right lung base, which is new.  The heart and pericardium appear_x000D_
 unremarkable._x000D_
_x000D_
 A post-pyloric feeding tube is in place, with the tip in the region of the_x000D_
 ligament of Treitz.  The [**Location (un) 1732**]-[**Location (un) 1733**] drainage catheter enters the skin in_x000D_
 the right lower quadrant, taking a course which terminates in the region of_x000D_
 the gallbladder fossa.  There is a radiolucent percutaneous biliary tube_x000D_
 present entering the right lobe of the liver, with a radiopaque tip.  There is_x000D_
 a small amount of contrast within this tube._x000D_
_x000D_
 A small amount of biliary air is present.  As there may be a subtlely_x000D_
 heterogeneous enhancement in segment 5 of the liver a tiny hypodense focus in_x000D_
 this region is non-specific, and was more discretely seen on prior studies._x000D_
 There is splenomegaly, with massive splenic varices and a splenorenal shunt._x000D_
 The kidneys, adrenal glands, stomach, and small bowel appears unremarkable._x000D_
 There is a large amount of post-operative fat stranding in the right upper_x000D_
 quadrant, worse in the remainder of the abdomen.  No frank fluid collection is_x000D_
 present, aside from the small sliver of fluid along the inferior aspect of the_x000D_
 liver, which is much smaller than on the prior study.  There is no abdominal_x000D_
 lymphadenopathy evident._x000D_
_x000D_
 CT OF THE PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  There is a large amount of stool within the_x000D_
 rectum.  A trace amount of pelvic free fluid is present.  There is no pelvic_x000D_
 lymphadenopathy, and the bladder and visualized portions of the ureters are_x000D_

 COMPARISON:  [**2110-7-31**]._x000D_
_x000D_
 TECHNIQUE:  Helically acquired contiguous axial images of the abdomen were_x000D_
 obtained without contrast and then with 140 cc of intravenous Optiray in_x000D_
 arterial and portal venous phases.  Delayed images of the abdomen and pelvis_x000D_
 were also obtained._x000D_
_x000D_
 ABDOMEN CT WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST:  There is minimal pleural effusion or_x000D_
 pleural thickening at the left lung base.  The transplant liver enhances_x000D_
 uniformly.  The portal, splenic, and superior mesenteric veins are patent. The_x000D_
 celiac, common hepatic, superior mesenteric and inferior mesenteric arteries_x000D_
 are patent.  A transhepatic percutaneous biliary stent is again noted.  There_x000D_
 is a second percutaneous catheter entering the patient in the right lower_x000D_
 quadrant, coursing superiorly and terminating in the liver hilum. The spleen_x000D_
 is stable in size.  Multiple varices and a markedly enlarged left renal vein_x000D_
 are again noted.  The pancreas, adrenal glands, and kidneys appear_x000D_
 unremarkable._x000D_
_x000D_
 PELVIS CT WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  There is contiguous wall thickening in_x000D_
 the sigmoid and descending colon, which is consistent with colitis._x000D_
 Inflammatory, infectious, and ischemic etiologies should be considered._x000D_
 Specifically, if the patient has been on antibiotics, C. difficile colitis_x000D_
 should be considered.  There is no wall thickening in the transverse or_x000D_
 ascending colon, which are distended with stool.  The distal ileum is_x000D_
 collapsed, with some fecalization of its contents (series 3B, image 182).  The_x000D_
 proximal small bowel is dilated and opacified with oral contrast.  Oral_x000D_
 contrast does not pass through to the collapsed distal small bowel.  These_x000D_
 findings are concerning for partial bowel obstruction, possibly secondary to_x000D_
 the large amount of stool in the proximal colon.  A follow-up CT scan may be_x000D_
 helpful to assess progression of oral contrast._x000D_
_x000D_
 There are multiple small foci of free air.  The largest collection of free air_x000D_
 is located adjacent to the distal jejunojejunal anastomosis (series 3B, image_x000D_
 159).  There is an adjacent 2 cm fluid collection.  There is also a small_x000D_
 amount of fluid in the paracolic gutters, and a small-to-moderate amount of_x000D_
 fluid in the deep pelvis.  These findings are concerning for bowel_x000D_

 REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:_x000D_
  Pt s/p liver transplant with existing [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1732**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1733**] drain. Tube to be downsized_x000D_
  and replaced with pigtail catheter by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 63**]._x000D_
 _______________________________________________________________________________x000D_
                                 FINAL REPORT_x000D_
 HISTORY:  Liver transplant, currently with right upper quadrant J-P drain and_x000D_
 transhepatic catheter, for J-P drain downsizing in anticipation of eventual_x000D_
 removal._x000D_
_x000D_
 TECHNIQUE/FINDINGS:  After informed consent was obtained, both the patient's_x000D_
 transhepatic biliary catheter as well as the J-P drain exit site were prepped_x000D_
 and draped in  sterile fashion._x000D_
_x000D_
 Initial injection of the J-P drain demonstrated prompt antegrade flow into_x000D_
 both a decompressed biliary tree as well as jejunum at approximately the_x000D_
 hepaticojejunal anastomosis.  Hence, a persistent leak, although previous_x000D_
 injections of the transhepatic catheter,  demonstrated no evidence of_x000D_
 extravasation at the level of the anastomosis._x000D_
_x000D_
 A stiff glide wire was advanced through the J-P drain and the J-P drain_x000D_
 removed.  Given the course of the J-P drain, no sheath was long enough to_x000D_
 reach the original final position of the drain.  Therefore, a 5-French multi-_x000D_
 side hole catheter was advanced over the wire to the level of the_x000D_
 hepaticojejunostomy and injection performed over the wire.  This revealed a_x000D_
 contained tract from the hepaticojejunal anastomosis and along the previous J-_x000D_
 P tract for approximately 10 cm.  Catheter withdrawal over a wire with_x000D_
 repeated injection demonstrated the tract to terminate after about 10 cm with_x000D_
 free contrast flowing into the abdomen._x000D_
_x000D_
 Hence, a tract approximately 10 cm in length, which is contained, does exist_x000D_
 where the previously J-P drain was placed.  Because of the route of the_x000D_
 original J-P drain, no drain of sufficient length to reach the hepaticojejunal_x000D_
 anastomosis is available (biliary drain, nephrostomy tubes and multi-purpose_x000D_
 drains all 35 cm or less, 65 cm  required to reach the hepaticojejunal_x000D_
 anastomosis through the previous J-P drain tract)._x000D_

_x000D_
 Therefore, a 7-French Grohlman catheter was used, additional multiple side_x000D_
 holes were placed and the catheter cut to appropriate size with an O-ring_x000D_
 placed.  This was sutured in place with 0-silk.  The catheter tip does form a_x000D_
 small pigtail and this was placed approximately 2 cm distal to the_x000D_
 hepaticojejunal anastomosis, i.e., withdrawn approximately 2 cm from the_x000D_
 original J-P drain tip.  Injection confirmed position and confirmed no_x000D_
 evidence of extravasation._x000D_
_x000D_
 A transhepataic cholangiogram was also performed, again demonstrating no_x000D_
 evidence of extravasation despite the known presence of a persistent leak.  As_x000D_
 this catheter has not been changed since [**4-20**], the catheter was changed_x000D_
 uneventfully over [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 2244**] wire for a similar 10-French biliary drainage_x000D_
 catheter._x000D_
_x000D_
 IMPRESSION:_x000D_
 1.  J-P drain injection demonstrating persistent leak at approximately the_x000D_
 hepaticojejunal anastomosis with opacification of both jejunum and a_x000D_
 decompressed biliary tree.  This is associated with a J-P drain tract of_x000D_
 approximately 10 cm in length from the hepaticojejunal anastomosis until_x000D_
 there is free extravasation into the abdomen.  J-P drain was removed and a_x000D_
 tailored 7-French catheter replaced approximately 8 cm within the tract,_x000D_
 distal to the hepaticojejunal anastomosis._x000D_
 2.  Due to the route of the original J-P drain, no larger drain or catheter_x000D_
 could be placed as the tract was over 65 cm in length._x000D_
 3.  Contained tract for 10 cm does make this amenable to an attempt at_x000D_
 eventual tract embolization._x000D_
 4.  Transhepatic cholangiogram demonstrating a nondilated biliary tree with_x000D_
 free flow into the jejunum via the hepaticojejunal anastomosis.  Again, no_x000D_
 extravasation was seen despite the above findings.  Catheter exchanged for a_x000D_
 similar 10-French biliary drain uneventfully._x000D_

 HISTORY: This is a patient status post liver transplant with recent rising_x000D_
 LFTs and bilirubin._x000D_
_x000D_
 RADIOLOGISTS: The procedure was performed by Drs. [**First Name (STitle) 766**] [**Name (STitle) 192**] and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 413**]_x000D_
 [**Doctor Last Name 7**]. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7**], the attending radiologist, was present and supervising_x000D_

 INDICATION: Hep C cirrhosis status post liver transplant. Abdominal pain._x000D_
 Prior CT of [**2110-9-4**], of six hours earlier suggested possible small_x000D_
 bowel obstruction. This is a followup scan for evaluation of contrast_x000D_
 throughput._x000D_
_x000D_
 TECHNIQUE: Noncontrast CT of the abdomen and pelvis was performed._x000D_
_x000D_
 CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT CONTRAST: Comparison to the previous exam reveals_x000D_
 only a minimal passage of contrast, which still lies within mid- to distal_x000D_
 small bowel. Compared to the prior exam, there is increase in the amount of_x000D_
 free fluid within the abdomen and pelvis. Colonic wall thickening is still_x000D_
 appreciated. No leak of oral contrast is seen. Loops of small bowel to the_x000D_
 point of contrast termination are still dilated._x000D_
_x000D_
 CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT CONTRAST: There is a mild increase in pelvic free_x000D_
 fluid since the previous exam._x000D_
_x000D_
 IMPRESSION: Only little movement of contrast within the small bowel, which_x000D_
 still terminates at a point within the mid-to-distal small bowel. As there was_x000D_
 no evidence of small bowel obstruction on recently performed interventional_x000D_
 study of [**2110-9-4**], (when administered contrast was seen to progress_x000D_
 through the small bowel without difficulty) the findings likely relate to an_x000D_
 ileus from chemical peritonitis. Additionally, the findings of bowel wall_x000D_
 thickening within the colon may relate to hypoproteinemia, or also could be_x000D_
 secondary to chemical peritonitis from biliary leak._x000D_

 situ, for cholangiogram, and possible downsizing of tube._x000D_
_x000D_
 PROCEDURE/FINDINGS:_x000D_
 The procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 4608**] [**Name (STitle) 4609**], and Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 63**] with Dr._x000D_
 [**Last Name (STitle) 63**], attending radiologist, supervising the procedure.  After explaining_x000D_
 the risks and benefits of the procedure and informed consent was obtained, the_x000D_
 patient was placed supine on the angiographic table, and the right upper_x000D_
 abdomen around the insertion site of the existing tube prepped and draped in_x000D_
 standard sterile fashion.  The skin and subcutaneous tissues surrounding the_x000D_
 catheter were anesthetized with 8 cc of 1% lidocaine.  A fluoroscopic spot_x000D_
 image was obtained demonstrating the catheter tip to be within the jejunum.  A_x000D_
 tube cholangiogram was then performed using 10 cc of hand injection contrast_x000D_
 which demonstrated opacification of the right hepatic duct, with free flow_x000D_
 into the jejunum.  No intrahepatic biliary dictal dilatation is seen.  No_x000D_
 leakage of contrast was seen.  The catheter was then cut releasing the_x000D_
 pigtail.  An 0.035 [**Last Name (un) 414**] wire was advanced through the existing catheter_x000D_
 into the jejunum under fluoroscopy, and the catheter was removed.  An 8 french_x000D_
 bright tipped sheath was advanced over the wire, and the inner dilator_x000D_
 removed.  Contrast was hand injected through the sheath which again_x000D_
 demonstrated normal right hepatic system, with no evidence of dilatation.  The_x000D_
 bright tipped sheath was removed and an 8 french biliary catheter was advanced_x000D_
 over the guidewire into the jejunum.  The guidewire was removed.  The pigtail_x000D_
 was formed and lodged in the jejunum beyond the anastomosis.  Repeat_x000D_
 cholangiography via the new 8 french biliary drainage catheter confirmed_x000D_
 position of sideholes throughout the biliary tree and into the jejunal loop._x000D_
 The contrast was aspirated and the catheter was flushed with 10 cc of normal_x000D_
 saline.  The catheter was capped, and secured to the skin using 0 silk suture._x000D_
  A stat-lock was applied, followed by a dry sterile gauze dressing._x000D_

 splenic hilum, and near the left kidney.  The left renal vein is markedly_x000D_
 enlarged with suggestion of an enlarged hemi-azygos inferior to the left_x000D_
 kidney. These appearances are unchanged when compared with previous CT_x000D_
 studies._x000D_
_x000D_
 The splenic vein and superior mesenteric vein in its visualized portions are_x000D_
 patent.  The portal confluence is patent.  There is attenuation of the portal_x000D_
 vein at its anastomotic site at the porta hepatis.  Within the liver, the_x000D_
 portal vein is patent._x000D_
_x000D_
 There is a 1.3 x 1.2 cm septated cystic lesion within the uncinate process of_x000D_
 the pancreas, which does not definitely communicate with the pancreatic duct._x000D_
 The differential diagnosis for this lesion includes an IPMT, a microcystic_x000D_
 tumor, or a sequela of prior pancreatitis. Follow up imaging in 4 months is_x000D_
 recommended to confirm its stability.  The pancreatic duct is normal in_x000D_
 caliber within the pancreatic body.  This duct is seen to continue into the_x000D_
 duct of Wirsung which is normal in caliber.  There is a dilated duct of_x000D_
 Santorini, measuring 7 mm with thickening of soft tissue at its ampulla. These_x000D_
 appearances may be a result of pancreas divisum with stenosis of the ampulla_x000D_
 of the duct of Santorini.  There is suggestion of another 5-6 mm cystic lesion_x000D_
 within the junction of the pancreatic body and tail which is not completely_x000D_
 visualized on this study, and may be additionally evaluated at the time of the_x000D_
 follow up imaging for the pancreas.  The common bile duct is normal in_x000D_
 caliber._x000D_

 marked on the right upper quadrant overlying the patient's collection.  The_x000D_
 region was then prepped and draped in the standard sterile fashion._x000D_
 Subsequently under direct CT guidance, a 19 gauge needle was advanced into_x000D_
 this collection. A 12 French Flexima locking loop catheter was then advanced_x000D_
 under CT guidance into the collection and a total of 350 cc of a combination_x000D_
 of bilious and bloody fluid was aspirated. The position of the catheter was_x000D_
 confirmed by CT and a locking loop was formed._x000D_
_x000D_
 A specimen was sent to the lab for interpretation._x000D_
_x000D_
 The patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate complication and_x000D_

 INDICATION:  52 y/o gentleman status post liver transplant with persistent_x000D_
 bile leak.  Presents for evaluation of source of leak._x000D_
_x000D_
 Physicians: Tham and [**Doctor Last Name 7**], with the Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7**] present and supervising_x000D_
_x000D_
 PROCEDURE:  Patient's abdomen was prepped and draped in sterile fashion. Tube_x000D_
 cholangiogram through patient's existing PTBD demonstrated a biliary leak_x000D_
 through peripheral medial duct as previously seen on prior studies. This_x000D_
 filled prior fluid collection before passing inferiorly and laterally into_x000D_
 subhepatic space. The patient's t-tube was then injected lightly with no_x000D_
 evidence of extravasation from the common bile duct. The patient tolerated the_x000D_
 procedure well and there were no complications._x000D_
_x000D_
 Impression: PTBD tube cholangiogram confirming previously seen biliary leak_x000D_
 through medial peripheral duct draining into fluid collection before passing_x000D_
 into subhepatic space. T-tube cholangiogram with no evidence of leak from CBD._x000D_

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 3825**] [**Known lastname 56003**] was born at 33_x000D_
6/7 weeks gestation by cesarean section for a nonreassuring_x000D_
fetal heart tracing.  Mother is a 28 year old gravida 5, para_x000D_
1, now 2 woman.  Mother's prenatal screens are blood type A_x000D_
positive, antibody negative, Rubella immune, RPR nonreactive_x000D_
and hepatitis surface antigen negative.  This pregnancy was_x000D_
complicated by a cerclage placement at 14 weeks gestation and_x000D_
intrauterine growth restriction of unclear etiology.  The_x000D_
mother's cytomegalovirus and toxoplasmosis titers were_x000D_
negative.  She had a low amniotic fluid index of 6.  The_x000D_
infant emerged vigorous.  Apgars were 8 at one minute and 9_x000D_
at five minutes._x000D_
_x000D_
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The birthweight was 1,640 gm, in the_x000D_
26th percentile and birth length was 79.5 cm, that is in the_x000D_
10th percentile and birth head circumference was 30 cm which_x000D_
is the 25th percentile for gestational age._x000D_
_x000D_
The admission physical examination reveals a vigorous preterm_x000D_
infant.  The anterior fontanelle is soft and flat._x000D_
Tachypnea.  Breath sounds clear.  Decreased perfusion._x000D_
Extremely pale.  No murmur.  Abdomen, soft, nontender and_x000D_
nondistended.  Extremities warm._x000D_
_x000D_
HOSPITAL COURSE:_x000D_
Respiratory status - The infant has always been in room air._x000D_
He has had some initial respiratory distress which resolved_x000D_
in the first 12 hours of life and he has remained in room air_x000D_
since that time.  He has had no apnea or bradycardia.  His_x000D_
respirations are comfortable.  Breath sounds are clear and_x000D_
equal._x000D_
_x000D_
Cardiovascular status - [**Location (un) 3825**] received some fluid_x000D_
resuscitation after admission for poor perfusion and_x000D_
metabolic acidosis which resolved.  He has remained_x000D_
normotensive since that time.  He has a regular heart rate_x000D_
and rhythm and no murmur._x000D_
_x000D_
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition - At the time of_x000D_
discharge, his weight is 2,005 gm, his length is 43.5 cm and_x000D_
his head circumference is 31 cm.  Enteral feeds were begun on_x000D_
day of life #1 and advanced to full volume feeds by day of_x000D_
life #4.  At the time of discharge he is eating 26 cal/oz_x000D_
breastmilk make with NeoSure powder and corn oil added to_x000D_
breastmilk on an ad lib schedule._x000D_
_x000D_
Gastrointestinal status - [**Location (un) 3825**] was treated with_x000D_
phototherapy with hyperbilirubinemia of prematurity on day of_x000D_
life #2 until day of life #8.  His peak bilirubin occurred on_x000D_
day of life #2 and was a total of 9.3, direct 0.3._x000D_
_x000D_
Urology - The infant was circumcised on [**2136-7-6**], and the_x000D_
area is healing well with mixed granulation tissue._x000D_
_x000D_
Hematology status - [**Location (un) 3825**] never received any blood product_x000D_
transfusions during his Neonatal Intensive Care Unit stay._x000D_
His hematocrit at the time of admission was 44.1._x000D_
_x000D_
Infectious disease status - He was started on ampicillin and_x000D_
gentamicin at the time of admission for sepsis risk factors._x000D_
After 48 hours the antibiotics were discontinued because the_x000D_

There is partial opacification of bilateral mastoid air cells as_x000D_
_x000D_
well as fluid seen within the left external auditory canal._x000D_
High-density_x000D_
material is seen within the bilateral maxillary sinuses and_x000D_
sphenoid sinuses compatible with blood. The right skull base_x000D_
fracture extends longitudinally through the temporal bone_x000D_
(series 2, image 39; series 401B, image 16). There is also a_x000D_
fracture that extends from the right posterior wall of the_x000D_
sphenoid sinus (series 401B, image 41; series 2, image 41) into_x000D_
the right carotid canal. A longitudinal left temporal bone_x000D_
fracture is noted that extends into the left parietal bone_x000D_
superiorly series 2, image 4).There is a minimally displaced_x000D_
fracture of the left zygoma (series 2, image 35) as well as the_x000D_
left lateral wall of the left orbit. A thin lucency noted at the_x000D_
superomedial aspect may represent a subtle fracture. No obvious_x000D_
extension into the TMJ is noted, the lucency noted on the_x000D_
studies in the posterior aspect of the TMJ relating to the site_x000D_
of [**Hospital1 **] of the mastoid and squamous portions of the temporal_x000D_
bone and seen on both sides. Thin non-displaced fracture of the_x000D_
lateral pterygoid is noted on the left. Scattered foci of air_x000D_
are noted including the right side of the neck , related to the_x000D_
trauma. Evaluation for any other subtle_x000D_
 fractures may be limited._x000D_

Brief Hospital Course:_x000D_
[**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the Trauma ICU for management of_x000D_
his traumatic brain injury.  His GCS at the scene was 3 and 7 at_x000D_
the time of admission.  He was seen by the Neurosurgical service_x000D_
for evaluation and placement of a bolt for ICP monitoring.His_x000D_
initial ICP was 10.  His left pupil was fixed and dilated and he_x000D_
had a left hemiparesis.  His right upper and lower extremities_x000D_
were moving.  He did require sedation while he was intubated as_x000D_
he was very agitated._x000D_
_x000D_
From a neurologic standpoint he has had marked improvement_x000D_
during his hospitalization.  He was treated with dilantin for 12_x000D_
days and had no seizure activity.  Following his extubation from_x000D_
the respirator he was able to speak and understand, respond to_x000D_
commands and his left sided weakness improved. He continued to_x000D_
have a left HP though this had been improving daily.  Most_x000D_
recent MRI of the C and T spine showed no cord contusion.  MRI_x000D_
of his brainshows axonal injury parietal and frontal white_x000D_
matter on left aswell as in the left corpus collosum and the_x000D_
right pons infarct,likely the cause of his left hemiparesis. His_x000D_
left CN III palsey is unchanged.  With the help of physical_x000D_
therapy he is up and walking but needs to refocus and needs_x000D_
reminders to concentrate._x000D_
_x000D_
[**Known firstname **] developed drainage from his right ear about 1 week ago and_x000D_
the consistency was old blood.  He was reevaluated by the_x000D_
Neurosurgery Service to assure that it was not CSF.  His_x000D_
drainage gradually decreased and resolved 48 hours ago. He will_x000D_
continue to follow up with Neurosurgery as an outpatient._x000D_
_x000D_
He was treated with antibiotics in the ICU for a presumed_x000D_
pneumonia.  His CXR is notable for b/l atelectesis and he has_x000D_
remained afebrile off antibiotcs for 24 hours. He is using his_x000D_
incentive spirometer.  On [**2140-11-2**] a right chest tube was placed_x000D_
for a hemothotax and this drained and was removed without_x000D_
difficulya few days later.  There is no effusion or pneumothorax_x000D_
on his post pull film._x000D_
_x000D_
His nutritional status is being monitored and he is tolerating a_x000D_
regular diet with nectar thick liquids.  He has been seen by the_x000D_
Speech and Swallow Service who recommend strict aspiration_x000D_
precautions and a repeat study after he gets settled in rehab._x000D_
_x000D_
During his hospitalization his family has been with him 24/7 and_x000D_
are very supportive, attentive and concerned for his future_x000D_
recovery.  They will appreciate_x000D_
updates as his condition improves or changes._x000D_

   Thank you for consulting on this 22 y/o male who was transferred from_x000D_
   OSH on [**10-30**] s/p fall off dirt bike at approximate speed of 35 mph. He_x000D_
   was found to be combative by EMS with GCS 6 and was intubated and_x000D_
   sedated  at OSH. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 19**]_x000D_
   for further management. Pt was found with  small SDH, SAH, prepontine_x000D_
   hemorrhage fractures of his L lateral orbit, left zygomatic, and_x000D_
   bilateral temporal bones. He had a bolt in place on the 21st to the_x000D_
   22nd with normal pressures. Pt also with dilated left pupil, likely_x000D_
   from peripheral 3rd nerve_x000D_
   palsy per neurology notes. CXR on [**11-3**] revealed increased RLL and_x000D_
   retrocardiac opacities which may represent PNA.  CXR on [**11-4**] pending._x000D_
   Pt self extubated [**11-3**] and was apparently complaining of paresthesias_x000D_
   in his left arm and leg.  He is currently NPO, pending our eval. We_x000D_
   were consulted to evaluate oral and pharyngeal swallow function to_x000D_
   determine the safest diet._x000D_
   EVALUATION:_x000D_
   The examination was performed while the patient was seated upright in_x000D_
   the chair on the TSICU._x000D_
   Cognition, language, speech, voice:_x000D_
   Pt was asleep upon entry to the room, but roused quickly. He was_x000D_
   oriented to person, but not date, and was confused about place (first_x000D_
   said ""[**Location (un) 2911**]"" and then ""hospital"").  He was also confused about_x000D_
   current job, at first reporting that he was in high school, but was_x000D_
   able to correctly id his place of employment with prompting from step_x000D_
   father (""High school was before, where do you work now?).  He also_x000D_

   However, pt was able to follow simple commands and was without_x000D_

   Face was grossly symmetrical. Tongue protruded at midline with adequate_x000D_
   ROM. Labial seal intact. Palatal elevation symmetric and gag present_x000D_
   with deep prodding._x000D_
   SWALLOWING ASSESSMENT:_x000D_
   Pt was offered ice chips, thin liquids (tsp, straw), nectar thick_x000D_
   liquids (tsp, straw), puree, ground solids, and soft solids.  Oral_x000D_
   phase was timely and without anterior spill. Laryngeal elevation was_x000D_
   WFL, but difficult to palpate due to cervical collar.  Pt coughed with_x000D_
   all trials of thin liquids and consecutive trials of soft solids. No_x000D_
   choking, 02 desats, or vocal quality changes were observed.  Sensation_x000D_
   appeared intact, given pt report of pharyngeal residue and ""I'm_x000D_

   SUMMARY / IMPRESSION:_x000D_
   Pt presents with s/sx of aspiration with thin liquids and consecutive_x000D_
   trials of soft solids.  A PO diet of ground solids and nectar thick_x000D_
   liquids is recommended.  Meds should be crushed in puree.  1:1_x000D_

_x000D_
 FINDINGS:  There is partial opacification of bilateral mastoid air cells as_x000D_
 well as fluid seen within the left external auditory canal.  High-density_x000D_
 material is seen within the bilateral maxillary sinuses and sphenoid sinuses_x000D_
 compatible with blood.  The right skull base fracture extends longitudinally_x000D_
 through the temporal bone (series 2, image 39; series 401B, image 16).  There_x000D_
 is also a fracture that extends from the right posterior wall of the sphenoid_x000D_
 sinus (series 401B, image 41; series 2, image 41) into the right carotid_x000D_
 canal.  A longitudinal left temporal bone fracture is noted that extends into_x000D_
 the left parietal bone superiorly series 2, image 4).There is a minimally_x000D_
 displaced fracture of the left zygoma (series 2, image 35) as well as the left_x000D_
 lateral wall of the left orbit. A thin lucency noted at the superomedial_x000D_
 aspect may represent a subtle fracture._x000D_
 No obvious extension into the TMJ is noted, the lucency noted on the studies_x000D_
 in the posterior aspect of the TMJ relating to the site of [**Hospital1 4980**] of the_x000D_
 mastoid and squamous portions of the temporal bone and seen on both sides._x000D_
 Thin non-displaced fracture of the lateral pterygoid is noted on the left._x000D_
 Scattered foci of air are noted including the right side of the neck , related_x000D_
 to the trauma._x000D_
 Evaluation for any other subtle fractures may be limited._x000D_

_x000D_
 There is complete consolidation of the left lower lobe which may be secondary_x000D_
 to aspiration.  There is consolidation within the superior segment of the_x000D_
 right lower lobe which may be secondary to aspiration.  Additionally_x000D_
 diffuse tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 462**] peripheral opacities in the right mid-lung are also likely_x000D_
 reflective of aspiration. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion._x000D_
 Subsegmental right basilar atelectasis is noted._x000D_

 HISTORY:  Status post ATV accident with bilateral skull base fractures_x000D_
 extending to the right carotid canal.  Evaluate for vascular injury._x000D_
_x000D_
 FINDINGS:_x000D_
_x000D_
 HEAD CT:  Please note that a repeat non-contrast head CT was not performed as_x000D_
 the CTA was performed immediately after the initial non-contrast head CT._x000D_
 Therefore, evaluation of known bilateral subarachnoid hemorrhages, hemorrhage_x000D_
 anterior to the pons and in the interpeduncular cistern is not well_x000D_
 appreciated on this contrast- enhanced study. There is no significant shift of_x000D_
 normally midline structures or evidence of hydrocephalus. Multiple skull base_x000D_
 fractures are again identified, better evaluated on initial head CT._x000D_
_x000D_
 CTA OF THE BRAIN:  The bilateral internal carotid arteries are intact.  There_x000D_
 is no evidence of intimal flap or dissection.  There is no evidence of_x000D_
 stenosis or occlusion within the intracranial portions of the bilateral_x000D_
 internal carotid arteries or vertebral arteries or their branches.  Focal_x000D_
 prominence of the right ACA just superior to the takeoff of the ACOM is noted_x000D_
 on the source images only.  This likely represents a tortuous vessel, although_x000D_
 tiny focal aneurysm cannot be entirely excluded.  No abnormalities are_x000D_
 otherwise seen in the anterior or posterior intracranial circulation._x000D_

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT axially acquired images through the brain were obtained.  No_x000D_
 IV contrast was administered.  Coronal and sagittal reformats were performed._x000D_
_x000D_
 FINDINGS:  Scattered foci of subarachnoid hemorrhage noted. Specifically,_x000D_
 in the left frontal lobe (2, 25), right parietal lobe (2, 18). Hemorrhage is_x000D_
 noted within the prepontine cistern (2, 12).  There is a possible 2-mm left_x000D_
 cerebral subdural hematoma (2, 21) although this may represent streak_x000D_
 artifact. Anterior to the pons, there is hyperdensity which appears linear on_x000D_
 sagittal views (400B, 44), likely an extra-axial hematoma. Increased density_x000D_
 within the anterior inferior aspect of the pons may represent a hemorrhagic_x000D_
 intra-axial contusion (400B, 44 and 2, 8).  There is no shift of normally_x000D_
 midline structures or hydrocephalus.  There is no intraventricular hemorrhage._x000D_
 Tiny foci of pneumocephalus is identified (2, 13) along the inferior left_x000D_
 frontal lobe. There is normal [**Doctor Last Name 107**]- white matter differentiation. There is no_x000D_
 evidence of acute major vascular territorial infarction._x000D_
_x000D_
 There is hyperdense fluid (compatible with blood) within the left maxillary,_x000D_
 sphenoid and ethmoid air cells as well as a small amount within the frontal_x000D_
 sinuses. There are multiple skull base fractures including bilateral_x000D_
 longitudinal temporal bone fractures, which extend to the middle ear_x000D_
 bilaterally.  The mastoid air cells are opacified, right greater than left._x000D_
 The right skull base fracture extends from the right posterior wall of the_x000D_
 sphenoid sinus into the right carotid canal. The left temporal bone fracture_x000D_
 extends into the posterior wall of the left TMJ joint as well as superiorly_x000D_
 into the left parietotemporal bone (3, 25). There are fractures of the left_x000D_
 zygoma, left lateral and medial orbital wall (3, 15). The left orbital globe_x000D_
 appears grossly intact.  There is a small amount of periorbital soft tissue_x000D_
 swelling. Possible left lateral pterygoid fracture, although this is only seen_x000D_
 on a single image and may represent artifact (3, 6)._x000D_

 HISTORY:  22-year-old male with multiple facial fractures and bilateral_x000D_
 subarachnoid hemorrhage, now with agitation and tachypnea, concerning for_x000D_
 pulmonary embolism._x000D_

 COMPARISON:  Initial CT torso of [**2140-10-30**] as well as multiple interval chest_x000D_
 radiographs._x000D_
_x000D_
 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT axial imaging was performed through the chest after the_x000D_
 uneventful administration of 100 mL of IV Optiray 350.  Multiplanar_x000D_
 reformatted images as well as oblique maximal intensity projection images were_x000D_
 then obtained._x000D_
_x000D_
 CTA CHEST:  There is interval development of a sizable left pneumothorax with_x000D_
 perhaps slight shift of the mediastinal contents towards the right since CT_x000D_
 torso of [**2140-10-30**].  Also note is made that the patient has left-sided anterior_x000D_
 chest tube is not within the pleural cavity and terminates within the_x000D_
 subcutaneous soft tissues of the anterolateral chest wall.  There is_x000D_
 subcutaneous gas along bilateral anterior chest wall.  Also, there is apparent_x000D_
 gas within the anterior mediastinum (2:16), and also along the right heart_x000D_
 margin (2:4, 31, 57)._x000D_

 Extra-axial fluid matching the density of cerebral spinal fluid is seen in the_x000D_

_x000D_
_x000D_
History of Present Illness:_x000D_
Patient is a 72-year-old gentleman who is admitted with_x000D_
symptomatic penetrating_x000D_
descending thoracic aortic ulcer. The patient remained_x000D_
symptomatic from pain standpoint despite adequate medical_x000D_
management with some radiographic evidence of progression of the_x000D_
internal hematoma. The patient was therefore felt to be a_x000D_
good candidate for stent graft placement to cover the_x000D_
penetrating ulcer. The penetrating ulcer appeared to be at the_x000D_
T9-T10 level by CT scan. The patient understood the risks and_x000D_
benefits of the procedure and wished to proceed._x000D_

Brief Hospital Course:_x000D_
Mr. [**Known lastname 66702**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2187-3-2**] for further_x000D_
work-up of his epigastric pain. A CT Angiogram was performed_x000D_
which revealed a tiny penetrating ulcer-like projection in the_x000D_
distal descending thoracic aorta, with adjacent crescentic_x000D_
hematoma, which appeared contained within the aortic wall_x000D_
without evidence of active extravasation. Given these findings,_x000D_
the vascular and cardiac surgical services were consulted for_x000D_
surgical management. Mr. [**Known lastname 66702**] was worked-up in the usual_x000D_
preoperative manner. He remained on nitroglycerin for blood_x000D_
pressure control. On [**2187-3-5**], Mr. [**Known lastname 66702**] was taken to the_x000D_
operating room where he underwent an endovascular stent_x000D_
placement. Postoperatively he was taken to the cardiac surgical_x000D_
intensive care unit for monitoring. By postoperative day one,_x000D_
Mr. [**Known lastname 66702**] [**Last Name (Titles) 5058**] neurologically intact and was extubated. His_x000D_
lumbar drain was removed on postoperative day two and he was_x000D_
then transferred to the step down unit for further recovery. The_x000D_
physical therapy service was consulted for assistance with his_x000D_
postoperative strength and mobility. He continued to make steady_x000D_
progress and was discharged home on postoperative day three. Mr._x000D_
[**Known lastname 66702**] will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and_x000D_
his primary care provider as an outpatient._x000D_

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion._x000D_
Conclusions_x000D_
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall_x000D_
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are_x000D_
normal (LVEF >55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right_x000D_
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The_x000D_
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3)_x000D_
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No_x000D_
masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but cannot_x000D_
be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality. Trace aortic_x000D_
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly_x000D_
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral_x000D_
regurgitation is seen. There is borderline pulmonary artery_x000D_
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion._x000D_
_x000D_
IMPRESSION: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets without_x000D_
obvious vegetation. Trace aortic regurgitation. Mild mitral_x000D_
regurgitation. Preserved regional and global LV systolic_x000D_
function._x000D_
_x000D_
If clinically suggested, the absence of a vegetation by 2D_x000D_
echocardiography does not exclude endocarditis._x000D_
_x000D_
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2187-4-11**],_x000D_
the findings are similar. The prior echo measured the ascending_x000D_
aorta as 4.5cm but this was likely an OVERestimation._x000D_

size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). There is no_x000D_
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion_x000D_
are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets_x000D_
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No masses or_x000D_
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to_x000D_
suboptimal image quality. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve_x000D_
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+)_x000D_
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic_x000D_
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion._x000D_
_x000D_
IMPRESSION: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets without obvious vegetation._x000D_
Trace aortic regurgitation. Mild mitral regurgitation. Preserved regional and_x000D_
global LV systolic function._x000D_
_x000D_
If clinically suggested, the absence of a vegetation by 2D echocardiography_x000D_
does not exclude endocarditis._x000D_
_x000D_
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2187-4-11**], the findings are_x000D_
similar. The prior echo measured the ascending aorta as 4.5cm but this was_x000D_
likely an OVERestimation._x000D_

 CTA CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:  Patient is status post metallic stent placement_x000D_
 in the descending thoracic aorta adjacent to the region of small aortic_x000D_
 ulceration and intramural hematoma.  The stent appears intact and in good_x000D_
 position.  Posterior wall of the native aorta remains thickened; however, is_x000D_
 unchanged from the prior CT.  There is no evidence of air or other specific CT_x000D_
 evidence to suggest abscess or peristent infection.  The remainder of the_x000D_
 thoracic aorta is unremarkable.  Pulmonary arteries enhance normally.  The_x000D_
 heart, pericardium, and great vessels are normal in appearance.  The lungs are_x000D_
 clear.  Motion artifact limits assessment of the lung bases._x000D_
_x000D_
 CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  The abdominal aorta enhances normally without_x000D_
 evidence of dissection, ulceration, or aneurysmal dilatation.  Severe motion_x000D_
 artifact limits assessment of the abdomen and pelvis.  Allowing for this_x000D_
 limitation, the liver, spleen, gallbladder, kidneys, adrenal glands, pancreas,_x000D_
 and intra-abdominal bowel appear grossly normal with the exception of a_x000D_

 CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  The intrapelvic aorta and iliac branches opacify_x000D_
 normally without evidence of dissection, ulceration, or aneurysmal dilatation._x000D_
 In the most inferior images, there is thickening of the lateral wall, with a_x000D_
 markedly enlarged prostate impressing on the base of the bladder.  Given the_x000D_

 INDICATION:  72-year-old male with known atherosclerotic ulcer and possible_x000D_
 periaortic hematoma, now with recurrence of substernal back pain.  Evaluate_x000D_
 descending thoracic aorta for an atherosclerotic ulcer/hematoma._x000D_
_x000D_
 No comparison studies._x000D_
_x000D_
 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT acquired axial images of the chest were obtained without IV_x000D_
 contrast.  Chest, abdomen and pelvis images were then performed with IV_x000D_
 contrast.  Multiplanar and thin-slice reformations were obtained according to_x000D_
 the Aorta CTA protocol._x000D_
_x000D_
 CT CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST:  Lung windows demonstrate dependent_x000D_
 atelectatic changes.  Soft tissue windows demonstrate a few nonpathologically_x000D_
 enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes.  No pathological enlarged lymph nodes within_x000D_
 the axilla and hila.  The proximal pulmonary arterial vasculature demonstrates_x000D_
 no filling defects.  Examination not optimal for pulmonary emboli evaluation._x000D_
 No evidence of pericardial effusions. Small left pleural effusion._x000D_
_x000D_
 CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  The liver, pancreas, spleen, adrenal glands are_x000D_
 within normal limits.  The gallbladder is difficult to visualize. There are_x000D_
 multiple low-attenuation lesions within the left kidney, one within the middle_x000D_
 pole, likely representing simple renal cyst, the others are too small to_x000D_
 characterize.  Small bowel and large bowel are unremarkable.  No_x000D_
 pathologically enlarged nodes within the retroperitoneum or mesentery._x000D_
_x000D_
 CTA AORTA:  As was previously described on outside CT report, there is focal_x000D_
 soft tissue thickening immediately adjacent to and/or within the_x000D_
 posterolateral wall of the distal descending thoracic aorta.  The overall_x000D_
 outer axial diameters at this level are 3.5 cm x 3.4 cm. The aortic lumen_x000D_
 measures 2.5 cm, with the thickness of this soft tissue crescentic area_x000D_
 measuring 10 mm. It extends over about a 4 cm sagittal length. Protruding from_x000D_
 the lumen into this soft tissue, there is a tiny approximately 3 mm_x000D_
 penetrating ulcer / beak- like projection of contrast that has been described_x000D_
 on outside reports. There is no definite evidence of active extravasation._x000D_

 TECHNIQUE:  Axial and sagittal T1- and T2-weighted imaging was performed of_x000D_
 the cervical and thoracic spine.  Gadolinium-enhanced images were obtained._x000D_
_x000D_
 FINDINGS:  Sagittal images of the cervical spine demonstrate a small disc_x000D_
 bulge with extrusion superiorly at the level of C4-C5 that is abutting upon_x000D_
 the thecal sac and spinal cord.  An additional disc bulge is seen at the level_x000D_

 Within the thoracic spine at the level of T4, extensive left ligamentous_x000D_
 hypertrophy is pushing upon the thecal sac and spinal cord with no evidence of_x000D_
 compression.  At the level of T6, there is a hyperdense focus within the T6_x000D_
 vertebral body on T1-weighted images, likely representing benign degenerative_x000D_
 change.  At the level of T9-T10, there is moderate anterior osteophyte_x000D_
 formation with mild hyperintensity seen on noncontrast-enhanced T2-weighted_x000D_
 images and STIR images.  There is very mild enhancement post-gadolinium_x000D_
 administration within the T10 vertebral body.  Within this region, there is no_x000D_
 evidence of disc enhancement.  There is no evidence of cord or thecal sac_x000D_

 FINDINGS:_x000D_
_x000D_
 Ascending arch and descending thoracic aorta are normal in caliber.  Interval_x000D_
 placement of a 10cm descending thoracic aortic arch endoluminal stent_x000D_
 extending from just inferior to the arch to the distal descending thoracic_x000D_
 aorta.  A thin crescentic area of thickening along the posterior and_x000D_
 posterolateral descending thoracic aorta measuring up to 1 cm is located at_x000D_
 the most inferior extent of the endoluminal thoracic aortic graft (series 3,_x000D_
 image 70).  This is at the site of small prior intramural ulceration, no_x000D_
 evidence of residual ulceration at that point._x000D_
 Just below the inferior most extent of the stent graft, there is a small (7 mm_x000D_
 x 4 mm) area of ulceration into the posterior descending thoracic aortic wall_x000D_
 (series 3, image 80) without associated mural thickening. The descending_x000D_
 thoracic aorta at that level is normal in caliber at 2.5 cm._x000D_
_x000D_
 The abdominal aorta is normal in caliber measuring 2 cm just below the origin_x000D_
 of the renal arteries.  The celiac, superior mesenteric, inferior mesenteric,_x000D_
 and renal arteries are widely patent and normal in caliber.  There are two_x000D_
 left renal arteries which share a common ostial origin.  Mild atheromatous_x000D_
 calcification in the abdominal aorta, both common, internal, and external_x000D_
 iliac arteries are widely patent and normal in caliber._x000D_
_x000D_
 CT SCAN OF THORAX:_x000D_
_x000D_
 Lungs clear.  No mass lesion or mediastinal lymphadenopathy.  Tiny 3-mm_x000D_
 granuloma in the right middle lobe anteriorly (series 3, image 47).  Normal_x000D_
 heart size and normal-caliber central pulmonary arterial vasculature._x000D_
_x000D_
 CT SCAN OF ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:_x000D_

 Portable semi-upright chest with indication of pneumothorax._x000D_
_x000D_
 Left-sided chest tubes remain in place.  A tiny left apical pneumothorax has_x000D_
 decreased in size, in retrospect since recent study.  Cardiomediastinal_x000D_
 contours appear less widened, and there has been slight improvement in the_x000D_
 degree of fluid overload.  Retrocardiac opacification and bilateral pleural_x000D_
 effusions are probably unchanged, but exclusion of left costophrenic sulcus_x000D_
 from the radiograph limits full assessment of the left pleural effusion._x000D_

_x000D_
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Patient with descending thoracic aortic graft with_x000D_
 infection.  For further evaluation to exclude spinal involvement._x000D_
_x000D_
 THORACIC SPINE:_x000D_
_x000D_
 TECHNIQUE:  T1, T2, and inversion recovery sagittal, and T2 axial images_x000D_
 obtained before gadolinium.  T1 sagittal and axial images obtained following_x000D_
 gadolinium._x000D_
_x000D_
 Correlation was made with the previous abdominal CT.  Correlation was also_x000D_
 made with the previous thoracic spine MRI of [**2187-4-13**]._x000D_
_x000D_
 FINDINGS:  As seen on the CT examination of [**2189-7-3**], there is postoperative_x000D_
 change seen in the descending aorta.  At the level of T8-T10 vertebra, there_x000D_
 is focal dilatation of the aorta.  Soft tissue changes are seen surrounding_x000D_
 the aorta, T8-T10 level.  The T10 vertebral body demonstrates increased signal_x000D_
 on the left side on inversion recovery images with decreased signal on T1-_x000D_
 weighted images.  This is adjacent to the focal dilatation of the aorta._x000D_
 Following gadolinium, subtle enhancement is seen in this region.  These_x000D_
 findings are indicative of periaortic inflammation with pressure erosion or_x000D_
 early osteomyelitis of the T10 vertebral body.  There is no epidural abscess_x000D_
 identified.  At T4-T5 level, there is hypertrophic change seen in the facet_x000D_
 joint on the left side with indentation on the left side of the spinal cord._x000D_
 This appears degenerative in nature.  Mild multilevel degenerative changes are_x000D_
 seen in the thoracic vertebral bodies.  There is no intrinsic signal_x000D_
 abnormality within the spinal cord.  No abnormal intraspinal enhancement is_x000D_
 seen._x000D_

Brief Hospital Course:_x000D_
Mrs. [**Known lastname 56811**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2122-7-14**] for emergent_x000D_
surgical management of her type A dissection. She was taken to_x000D_
the operating room where she underwent replacement of her_x000D_
ascending aorta and hemiarch using a 38mm gelweave graft._x000D_
Postoperatively she was taken to the cardiac surgical intensive_x000D_
care unit for monitoring. She received multiple blood products._x000D_
Her sedation was weaned to off but she remained unresponsive to_x000D_
pain without pupillary reflex, head CT showed Subacute_x000D_
infarction involving the cerebellum, frontal, parietal, and_x000D_
occipital lobes bilaterally as well as chronic infarction in the_x000D_
right temporal lobe. She began having seizures and was loaded_x000D_
with and started on dilantin. She was followed closely by_x000D_
neurology. Dobhoff tube was placed and she was started on tube_x000D_
feeds._x000D_
She remained unresponsive. Repeat head ct showed Multiple_x000D_
bilateral hypodensities consistent with evolving subacute_x000D_
infarction. She was started on cipro and zosyn for gram negative_x000D_
bacteria in sputum and UTI. General surgery consulted to plan_x000D_
for trach/PEG placement. Her neuro exam improved very slightly_x000D_
and she opened her eyes to noxious stim. Repeat EEG showed mild_x000D_
to moderate encephalopathy but no evidence of seizures._x000D_
Neurological prognosis remained poor. Tracheostomy and PEG tube_x000D_
were placed on [**7-27**]. Dilantin level should be maintained at_x000D_
15-20. Tube feeds were restarted, and she tolerated 8 hours of_x000D_
trach collar. PICC line became totally occluded seconadry to IV_x000D_
dilantin and her dilantin was changed to PO. BUE U/S for edema_x000D_
showed right axillary DVT but none on left. PICC line was_x000D_
changed to a single lumen. She was raedy for discharge to rehab_x000D_
on [**7-29**]._x000D_

 The ET tube tip is about 6 cm above the carina.  The NG tube_x000D_
 intrathoracic portion  is displaced to the left from its expected location,_x000D_
 most likely in the stomach , due to leftward mediastinal shift and left lower_x000D_

 demonstrated, most likely related to the recent surgery.  The Swan- Ganz_x000D_

 TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images were obtained through the brain without_x000D_
 contrast.  Subsequently, rapid axial imaging was performed from the aortic_x000D_
 arch through the brain during infusion of Omnipaque IV contrast.  Images were_x000D_
 processed on a separate workstation with display of curved reformats, volume_x000D_
 rendered images, maximum intensity projection images._x000D_
_x000D_
 HEAD CT WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  The right temporal lobe demonstrates a well-_x000D_
 defined focus of hypoattenuation indicative of encephalomalacia, likely from_x000D_
 prior infarction (2:16).  Additional less well-defined hypodensities in the_x000D_
 frontal lobes, the parietal lobes, occipital lobes, and the cerebellum_x000D_
 bilaterally are consistent with edema due to subacute infarction._x000D_
 Periventricular hypoattenuation is consistent with chronic small vessel_x000D_
 ischemic disease.  The visualized paranasal sinuses are clear.  The mastoid_x000D_
 air cells are clear. There is no fracture.  The patient is intubated._x000D_
_x000D_
 HEAD AND NECK CTA:  There is severe atheromatous disease involving the aorta_x000D_
 and the common carotid arteries bilaterally.  The left subclavian demonstrates_x000D_
 a long segment of severe atherosclerotic change.  There is an approximately_x000D_
 33% stenosis of the proximal right ICA at the right carotid bifurcation. There_x000D_
 is a 1.2-cm segment of the distal cervical left internal carotid artery which_x000D_
 demonstrates a fenestration or possible dissection (3:187).  The left_x000D_
 vertebral artery demonstrates an approximately 65% stenosis at its origin_x000D_
 ([**Numeric Identifier 28951**]:25, 695).  The major intracranial vessels are patent, with no evidence_x000D_
 of aneurysm formation._x000D_

 RADIOLOGIST: Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 5473**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5549**] performed the procedure.  The_x000D_
 Attending Radiologist, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 5473**], was present and supervising throughout._x000D_
_x000D_
 TECHNIQUE: Using sterile technique and local anesthesia, a 0.018 guidewire was_x000D_
 advanced through the indwelling left arm double lumen PICC line. The wire_x000D_
 could not be advanced through the catheter due to blockage at its mid portion_x000D_
 and a 0.018 glidewire was also ineffective at traversing the obstructed_x000D_
 portion through either lumen. Therefore, a close-fitting 4 Fr peel- away_x000D_
 sheath was then advanced over the old PICC to secure access. The old PICC line_x000D_
 and the wire were then removed. A single lumen catheter measuring 55 cm in_x000D_
 length with 51.5 cm inside of the patient was then placed through the peel-_x000D_
 away sheath with its tip positioned at the brachiocephalic junction under_x000D_
 fluoroscopic guidance. (Tip postion was pulled back from SVC as catheter tip_x000D_
 preferentially abutted right lateral wall of SVC) Position of the catheter was_x000D_
 confirmed by a fluoroscopic spot film of the chest. The peel- away sheath and_x000D_
 guidewire were then removed. The catheter was secured to the skin, flushed,_x000D_
 and a sterile dressing applied. The sleeping patient tolerated the procedure_x000D_
 well. There were no immediate complications._x000D_
_x000D_
 IMPRESSION:: Uncomplicated fluoroscopically guided left single lumen PICC line_x000D_
 exchange. Final internal length is 51.5 cm (3.5 cm outside of the patient)_x000D_

CSF rhinorrhea. He had underwent a right craniotomy for mass_x000D_
resection on [**2181-10-5**]. The pathology was Metastatic_x000D_
adenocarcinoma. He was readmitted for CSF leak from [**2181-11-7**]_x000D_
         to [**2181-11-16**] and had a lumbar drain from [**2181-11-9**] to_x000D_
[**2181-11-16**]. He had a recurrance of CSF rhinorrhea and was admitted_x000D_
on [**2181-11-18**]._x000D_
_x000D_
Upon admission he also reported left calf tenderness with a_x000D_
positive [**Doctor Last Name **] sign. Lower extremity doppler study was_x000D_
negative on [**11-18**]. Repeat studies showed LLE thrombosis_x000D_
involving superficial calf veins. He was kept on bedrest until_x000D_
being taken to surgery on [**2181-11-21**] for a right craniotomy for_x000D_
dural repair and lumbar drain placement with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. He was_x000D_
extubated and transfered to the SICU after the procedure. The_x000D_
lumbar drain parameters were 15cc/CSF as goal._x000D_
_x000D_
Post-op CT imaging showed mild pneumocephalus and post-surgical_x000D_
changes.  He was trasnfered to the [**Hospital Ward Name **] 11 floor. On [**11-22**] his_x000D_
HOB was at 25 degress max and he had no sign of CSF leak. On_x000D_
[**11-23**] he had a temp of 102. Fever work up was initiated which_x000D_
included CSF sample from lumbar drain. He became disoriented and_x000D_
agitated later that day. His CSF studies showed WBC 380._x000D_
Peripheral WBC was 19._x000D_
_x000D_
He was transfered to the SICU. ID was consulted and Vancomycin_x000D_
and Cefipime were ordered. They recommended that the LD be_x000D_
removed. The tip was sent for culture which had no growth. The_x000D_
patient improved clincally within 24 hours and had a normal_x000D_
neurological exam. He was transferred to surgical floor 48 hours_x000D_
later and remained afebrile. ID recommended 14 days of IV_x000D_
antibiotics and one week further treatment for C-Diff. He had no_x000D_
headache or rhinorrhea. PT recommended he be discharged home_x000D_

 enlarged.  These findings are stable in comparison to the prior CT_x000D_
 examination._x000D_
_x000D_
 There is no evidence of a new hemorrhage, edema, masses, mass effect, or_x000D_
 infarction.  The [**Doctor Last Name 107**]-white matter differentiation is preserved and unchanged_x000D_
 from prior exam.  The ventricles are unchanged in size from prior exam.  The_x000D_

 HISTORY:  A 53-year-old male after a brain metastasis resection with a_x000D_
 question of CSF rhinorrhea.  According to the medical record, the patient has_x000D_
 increasing nasal discharge and postnasal drip for one week._x000D_
_x000D_
 TECHNIQUE:  Noncontrast head CT was performed.  Sagittal and coronal_x000D_
 reformatted images of the temporal bones were generated._x000D_
_x000D_
 FINDINGS:  The patient is post-right temporal mass resection.  In comparison_x000D_
 to the most recent prior studies, there is no longer shift of midline_x000D_
 structures.  The edema has essentially resolved.  There is no hydrocephalus or_x000D_
 intracranial hemorrhage._x000D_
_x000D_
 The right posterior ethmoid air cells are partially opacified.  The right_x000D_
 external and middle ear canals are patent.  There is focal opacification_x000D_
 laterally and dependently of the right frontal sinus in the area of the_x000D_
 craniotomy.  There is mucoscal thickening of bilateral anterior ethmoid air_x000D_
 cells._x000D_
_x000D_
 The left maxillary sinus is nearly completely opacified, there is new, near_x000D_
 complete opacification of the left mastoid air cells.  The left sphenoid,_x000D_
 ethmoid, and frontal sinuses are well aerated.  There is partial opacification_x000D_
 of bilateral anterior ethmoid air cells.  The left middle ear is opacified_x000D_
 with soft tissue density.  The left external ear canal is patent._x000D_

 3.  Near complete opacification of the left maxillary sinus, similar to the_x000D_
 prior studies, with near complete opacification of the left mastoid air cells_x000D_
 and new opacification of the left middle ear._x000D_
_x000D_
 NOTE ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW: The frontal craniotomy extended through the_x000D_
 right frontal sinus, involving the anterior and posterior walls. This portion_x000D_
 of the sinus is opacified, and there is a small air bubble in the surgical_x000D_
 defect in the anterior wall of the sinus. Overall, these findings suggest this_x000D_
 is the source of the CSF leak. These findings were discussed with [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3922**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 399**]_x000D_

_x000D_
 TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images were obtained through the brain.  No_x000D_
 intravenous contrast was administered._x000D_
_x000D_
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post right craniotomy and resection of known_x000D_
 right temporal mass.  Redemonstrated is the right frontal craniotomy site with_x000D_
 extension through to the right frontal sinus, with associated opacification_x000D_
 and air seen within the right frontal sinus, that likely serves as the site_x000D_
 for cerebrospinal fluid leak.  Overall, there is little interval change, with_x000D_
 no evidence of new hemorrhage, edema, masses, mass effect, or acute_x000D_
 infarction. The [**Doctor Last Name 107**]-white matter differentiation is preserved.  There is mild_x000D_
 persistent hypodensity within the right temporal region compatible with_x000D_
 residual edema status post resection. There is no evidence of  shift of_x000D_
 midline structures. The ventricles and sulci are stable in size and_x000D_
 configuration. There is complete opacification of the left maxillary sinus and_x000D_
 mastoid air- cells and opacification involving the right frontal sinus and_x000D_
 partial opacification of the right mastoid air- cells._x000D_

 FINDINGS:  In the right frontoparietal surgical site, there is a small amount_x000D_
 of pneumocephalus along the right frontal convexity.  A small amount of soft_x000D_
 tissue subcutaneous air and soft tissue swelling is also noted.  There is a_x000D_
 sliver of hyperdensity tracking along the right frontoparietal convexity_x000D_
 measuring less than 1 mm in thickness, likely represent post-surgical tiny_x000D_
 subdural hematoma.  There is minimal effacement of adjacent sulci.  No other_x000D_
 intracranial hemorrhage is noted.  There is no fluid collection to suggest CSF_x000D_
 leakage.  The ventricles and sulci are otherwise normal in configuration and_x000D_
 appearance.  There is no shift of normally midline structures.  The [**Doctor Last Name 107**]-white_x000D_
 matter differentiation is well preserved.  Other than the right frontal and_x000D_
 frontoparietal region craniotomy sites, there is no bony deformity.  Again_x000D_
 noted is some fluid collection in the right lateral frontal sinus.  There is_x000D_

 MEDICAL HISTORY:  52-year-old man with lung cancer and brain metastasis status_x000D_
 post craniotomy, now with large pulmonary embolism.  Request was made for an_x000D_
 IVC filter placement._x000D_
_x000D_
 CLINICIANS:  Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 9422**] [**Name (STitle) 90**] and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 411**] [**Name (STitle) 412**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 412**] is the_x000D_
 attending radiologist who was present and supervising throughout._x000D_
_x000D_
 ANESTHESIA:  Moderate sedation was provided by administering divided doses of_x000D_
 100 mcg of Fentanyl and 2 mg of Versed throughout the total intraservice time_x000D_
 of 45 minutes during which the patient's hemodynamic parameters were_x000D_
 continuously monitored.  Local anesthesia obtained with 1% lidocaine._x000D_
_x000D_
 PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  Informed consent was obtained after explaining the_x000D_
 procedure, risks and benefits of the procedure.  The patient was brought to_x000D_
 angiography suite and placed supine on the imaging table.  The right groin was_x000D_
 prepped and draped in the standard sterile fashion.  A preprocedure huddle and_x000D_
 time-out were performed as per [**Hospital1 184**] protocol.  Using fluoroscopic and_x000D_
 ultrasound guidance and after injection of 8 cc of 1% lidocaine, a 19-gauge_x000D_
 needle was used to puncture the right common femoral vein.  A 0.035 [**Last Name (un) 89**]_x000D_
 wire was advanced through the needle into the inferior vena cava under_x000D_
 fluoroscopic guidance.  The needle was then exchanged for a 5-French Omni_x000D_
 flush catheter which was advanced over the guidewire.  The Omni flush catheter_x000D_
 was redirected into the left common iliac vein over a 0.035 angled glidewire_x000D_
 and the wire removed.  The catheter was connected to the power injector and a_x000D_
 venogram obtained demonstrating a single patent inferior vena cava with no_x000D_
 thrombus. The left renal vein was the lowest and its position was noted on the_x000D_
 IVC gram with the help of a ruler.  Based on the diagnostic findings, it was_x000D_
 decided to place an inferior vena cava filter in the infrarenal position._x000D_
_x000D_
 The [**Last Name (un) 89**] wire was replaced through the Omni flush catheter and the catheter_x000D_
 removed.  Over the wire, the 5-French sheath from the Opt-Ease filter set was_x000D_
 placed and advanced up to a level of left renal vein which is the lower most._x000D_
 The inner dilator was removed and an Opt-Ease filter was advanced through the_x000D_

 placement of the filter.  The sheath was then removed and manual compression_x000D_
 was held for 10 minutes and hemostasis was achieved._x000D_

_x000D_
 HISTORY:  54-year-old male presents with metastatic nonsmall cell lung cancer._x000D_
_x000D_
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior brain MRIs [**2180-8-17**] through [**2182-3-4**]._x000D_

 TECHNIQUE:  Sagittal T1, axial pre- and post-gadolinium T1, T2 FSE, T2 GRE,_x000D_
 FLAIR, diffusion, sagittal post-gadolinium MP-RAGE with axial and coronal_x000D_
 reformatted sequences of the brain were obtained._x000D_
_x000D_
 FINDINGS:  There are evolving post-surgical changes following prior right_x000D_
 pterional craniotomy with resection of the large temporal mass.  The_x000D_
 appearance of the residual encephalomalacia is unchanged with asymmetric_x000D_
 dilatation of the right temporal [**Doctor Last Name 503**].  There is residual dural thickening and_x000D_
 slight nodular enhancement along the posterior and inferior aspect of the_x000D_
 resection cavity, also unchanged from the prior study (10:35).  Enhancement of_x000D_
 the sphenoid triangle is stable._x000D_
_x000D_
 There is a 15-mm nodular mass within the right CP angle cistern which has a_x000D_
 broad attachment to the tentorium and involves or compresses the enhancing_x000D_
 right trigeminal nerve.  The mass appears to extend into the cavernous sinus,_x000D_
 and/or Meckel's cave with equivocal extension into foramen ovale._x000D_
_x000D_
 There is no acute infarct.  There is a small residual fluid collection deep to_x000D_
 the craniotomy flap._x000D_
_x000D_
 IMPRESSION:_x000D_
 1.  Stable right temporal encephalomalacia, status post resection of the large_x000D_
 mass with unchanged nodularity along the posterior and inferior aspect of the_x000D_
 resection cavity._x000D_
_x000D_
 2.  More conspicuous on today's study is a right CP angle mass with a broad_x000D_
 attachment to the tentorium.  The mass extends into the cavernous sinus and,_x000D_
 given its rapid short interval enlargement, is concerning for a dural-based_x000D_
 metastasis.  Meningioma is another possibility but would be unlikely to_x000D_
 develop in this time frame._x000D_

 FINDINGS:  Post-surgical changes are noted status post right temporal_x000D_
 craniotomy, with a small fluid collection overlying the craniotomy site,_x000D_
 measuring 3.0 x 0.7 cm.  Additionally, there is T1 hyperintensity within the_x000D_
 right frontal sinus, consistent with the revision fat packing.  Since the_x000D_
 prior study, there has been significant interval decrease in the degree of_x000D_
 edema in the right hemisphere.  There is a small area of residual T2 and FLAIR_x000D_
 hyperintensity in the right temporal lobe, measuring 6.5 cubic cm, which is_x000D_
 significantly decreased since the prior examination.  There is a small single_x000D_
 focal area of nodular enhancement along the periphery of the resection cavity._x000D_
 There is mild leptomeningeal enhancement overlying the resection cavity which_x000D_
 is smooth in appearance, likely post-surgical in nature._x000D_
_x000D_
 Remainder of the brain parenchyma demonstrates stable appearance.  There is no_x000D_
 midline shift, mass effect or evidence of a space-occupying lesion.  There is_x000D_
 no new focus of abnormal enhancement.  The ventricles, sulci and cisterns_x000D_
 remain mildly prominent, but unchanged.  There are scattered areas of T2 and_x000D_
 FLAIR hyperintensity in the periventricular and subcortical white matter,_x000D_
 stable since the prior study.  There is no decreased diffusion to indicate an_x000D_
 acute infarct.  The flow voids of the major vessels are present._x000D_
_x000D_
 There is extensive fluid within the mastoid air cells bilaterally.  Mild_x000D_

 RADIOPHARMACEUTICAL DATA:_x000D_
    21.3 mCi F-18 FDG ([**2182-2-13**]);_x000D_
 INDICATION:  54 year-old male with a history of non-small cell lung cancer, now_x000D_
 restaging._x000D_
_x000D_
 METHODS: Approximately 1 hour after intravenous administration of F-18_x000D_
 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), noncontrast CT images were obtained for attenuation_x000D_
 correction and for fusion with emission PET images.  The noncontrast CT images_x000D_
 are not used to diagnose disease independently of the PET images.  A series of_x000D_
 overlapping emission PET images was then obtained. The fasting blood glucose_x000D_
 level, measured by glucometer before injection of FDG, was 96 mg/dL. The area_x000D_
 imaged spanned the region from the top of the head to the thighs._x000D_
_x000D_
 Computed tomography (CT) images were co-registered and fused with emission PET_x000D_
 images to assist with the anatomic localization of tracer uptake.  The_x000D_
 determination of the site of tracer uptake seen on PET data can have important_x000D_
 implications regarding the significance of that uptake._x000D_
_x000D_
 INTERPRETATION:_x000D_
 Comparison is made to the CT Torso from [**2182-1-17**]._x000D_
_x000D_
 HEAD AND NECK: There is no FDG-avid disease or significant lymphadenopathy in_x000D_
 the imaged portions of the head and the neck.  There is evidence of a prior_x000D_
 right-sided craniotomy with partial resection of the right temporal lobe._x000D_
_x000D_
 CHEST: There is a large area of FDG-avidity (18.9 SUV) corresponding to a_x000D_
 subcarinal lymph node described on the previous study measuring 42 x 39 mm_x000D_
 (image 96), much increased from previous study and concerning for a metastatic_x000D_
 lesion. There is no axillary or hilar lymphadenopathy. There is no pleural or_x000D_
 pericardial effusion._x000D_
_x000D_
 Additionally, the peri-fissural right upper lobe lung nodule described on_x000D_

 in the right lower lung lobe, there is 12 x 5 mm subpleural nodule that appears_x000D_
 unchanged from previous study and exhibits no FDG-avidity (image 107)._x000D_
_x000D_
 ABDOMEN/PELVIS: Below the diaphragm, tracer is distributed physiologically in_x000D_
 the gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts. There is no significant_x000D_
 lymphadenopathy and no FDG-avid disease.  An IVC filter is noted below the level_x000D_

 CLINICAL HISTORY:  54-year-old male with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer_x000D_
 to the brain, assess for progression._x000D_
_x000D_
 TECHNIQUE:  MRI of the brain was performed both before and after the_x000D_
 administration of intravenous contrast, as per the standard departmental_x000D_
 protocol.  Tumor volumetrics was also obtained._x000D_
_x000D_
 COMPARISONS:  MRI of the brain dated [**2182-1-7**] and [**2181-10-6**]._x000D_
_x000D_
 FINDINGS:  Post-surgical changes are again noted status post right frontal and_x000D_
 temporal craniotomy and resection of the previously seen mass within the right_x000D_
 temporal lobe.  There is a stable appearance of the resection cavity, with a_x000D_
 stable focus of nodular enhancement along the lateral aspect.  No new focus of_x000D_
 abnormal enhancement is identified.  Additionally, there is mild_x000D_
 pachymeningeal enhancement, most evident on the delayed FLAIR images which is_x000D_
 smooth in appearance and overlies the right frontal and parietal lobe.  T2 and_x000D_
 FLAIR signal changes in the right temporal lobe are stable in appearance._x000D_
_x000D_
 Post-surgical changes are also noted in the right frontal lobe, with the T1_x000D_
 hyperintensity decreased slightly since the prior study._x000D_
_x000D_
 There is no midline shift.  There is no acute hemorrhage or extra-axial_x000D_
 collection.  There is no decreased diffusion to indicate an acute infarct._x000D_
 The flow voids of the major vessels are present._x000D_
_x000D_
 Tumor volumetrics:  The area of residual FLAIR hyperintensity in the right_x000D_
 temporal lobe measures 7.38 cm3 on the current study compared with 6.5 cm3 on_x000D_
 the prior study, but given that the configuration is stable, this difference_x000D_
 is felt to be related to increased motion on the current study rather than_x000D_
 representing a true difference (with a FLAIR sequence that was even more_x000D_
 motion compromised giving a volume of 10.07 cm3)._x000D_
_x000D_
 IMPRESSION:  Stable appearance of the post-surgical changes status post right_x000D_
 temporal craniotomy and resection of the mass within the right temporal lobe_x000D_
 as well as revision of a CSF leak the right frontal sinus. The small focus of_x000D_

 INDICATION: 54 year-old-male with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer._x000D_
_x000D_
 METHODS: Approximately 1 hour after intravenous administration of F-18_x000D_
 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), noncontrast CT images were obtained for attenuation_x000D_
 correction and for fusion with emission PET images. [The noncontrast CT images_x000D_
 are not used to diagnose disease independently of the PET images.]  A series of_x000D_
 overlapping emission PET images was then obtained. The fasting blood glucose_x000D_
 level, measured by glucometer before injection of FDG, was 107 mg/dL. The area_x000D_
 imaged spanned the region from the skull to the pubic symphysis._x000D_
_x000D_
 Computed tomography (CT) images were co-registered and fused with emission PET_x000D_
 images to assist with the anatomic localization of tracer uptake.  The_x000D_
 determination of the site of tracer uptake seen on PET data can have important_x000D_
 implications regarding the significance of that uptake._x000D_
_x000D_
 INTERPRETATION:_x000D_
 Comparison is made to PET-CT on [**2182-2-13**] and MR [**Name13 (STitle) 1699**] on [**6-14**] and [**4-15**], [**2182**]._x000D_
_x000D_
 HEAD/NECK:  Again noted are hyper-pneumatized frontal sinuses.  The patient is_x000D_
 status post right frontotemporal craniotomy with similar right temporal_x000D_
 encephalomalacia.  The previously described nodular soft tissue lesion at the_x000D_
 right pretemporal area adjacent to the carotid canal now measures approximately_x000D_
 16 x 12 mm (Image 2:27) and demonstrates abnormal FDG-avidity at SUVmax 4.7,_x000D_

 right lower paratracheal node now measures 26 x 21 mm (Image 2:80) with_x000D_
 FDG-avidity at SUVmax 10.6.  A right upper paratracheal node measures 14 x 10 mm_x000D_
 (Image 2:77) with FDG-avidity at SUVmax 3.5._x000D_
_x000D_
 There is also moderate interval progression of FDG-avid (SUVmax 15.2) large_x000D_
 conglomerate subcarinal lymphadenopathy, now measures 67 x 44 mm (Image 2:97)_x000D_
 compared to 42 x39 mm previously._x000D_

 axial imaging was performed with [**Last Name (LF) 1168**], [**First Name3 (LF) 1169**] TR long TE fast spin echo,_x000D_
 gradient echo, diffusion, and short TR short TE spin echo technique.  Sagittal_x000D_

_x000D_
 FINDINGS:  There is continued enlargement of the right cavernous sinus mass_x000D_
 that fills Meckel's cave and extends posteriorly along the free edge of the_x000D_
 tentorium.  This has enlarged significantly since the study of [**6-14**], however_x000D_
 its irregular contours precludes meaningful measurement.  There have been no_x000D_
 other significant changes.  No other masses or regions of abnormal enhancement_x000D_
 are detected.  Again seen are postoperative changes with tissue loss in the_x000D_
 right temporal lobe.  Although an MRA examination was not performed, the_x000D_
 findings suggest encasement of the supraclinoid right internal carotid artery_x000D_
 by the mass._x000D_
_x000D_
 The mastoid air cells remain densely opacified._x000D_

 HISTORY:  Male with history of intermittent vertigo, for further evaluation._x000D_
_x000D_
 TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted images were acquired through the_x000D_
 cervical spine without administration of intravenous contrast.  There is no_x000D_
 relevant prior imaging for comparison._x000D_
_x000D_
 FINDINGS:_x000D_
_x000D_
 The C2-3 level is unremarkable with preserved alignment and disc anatomy._x000D_
_x000D_
 At C3-C4 level, there is bilateral uncovertebral joint hypertrophy with mild_x000D_
 effacement of the thecal sac and mild bilateral foraminal narrowing._x000D_
_x000D_
 At C4-5 level, there is severe left-sided foraminal narrowing due to_x000D_
 uncovertebral hypotrophy and mild right foraminal narrowing.  At C5-C6 level,_x000D_
 there is mild right foraminal narrowing due to uncovertebral hypertrophy._x000D_
_x000D_
 At C6-7 level, there is moderate bilateral foraminal narrowing due to_x000D_
 uncovertebral hypertrophy.  C7-T1 level, there is no significant disc disease_x000D_
 or joint abnormality.  There is no abnormal cord signal or abnormal_x000D_
 enhancement to suggest metastatic disease.  There is no abnormal marrow_x000D_
 signal._x000D_
_x000D_
 The C7-T1 level demonstrates a posterior central disc protrusion with minor_x000D_
 bilateral foraminal narrowing._x000D_
_x000D_
 The visualized brainstem and cerebellum appear unremarkable._x000D_
_x000D_
 IMPRESSION:_x000D_
_x000D_
 Multilevel degenerative changes with uncovertebral joint hypertrophy as_x000D_
